Ant and Dec win three TV Awards	Why is Facebook worth $15bn?	The amount of money saved in Individual Savings Accounts (ISAs) has now reached 208bn, according to figures from HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC).  ISAs, which let people avoid income or capital gains tax on their savings, have shot up in value in recent years.  Their total value has risen sevenfold from 29bn since 1 April 2000.  It means that almost as much is held in ISAs as is owed by people on credit cards and other forms of non-mortgage debt, such as bank loans.  The Bank of England recently reported that such debt in the UK stood at 216bn.  Fresh investment  The increase in the value of ISAs is due to two things.  The first is the investment return on the cash accounts and the stocks and shares in which the savers' money has been invested.  The other factor is the amount of fresh money invested each year, offset by people withdrawing their money to spend or save elsewhere.  For several years, fresh investment was steady, at around 28bn each year.  But in the past couple of years that has risen, to 33bn in the 2006-07 financial year.  New rules  More than 17 million people currently have an ISA account, of whom 13.6 million made fresh contributions last year.  A quite high proportion of the adult population has bought into the tax advantages of using an ISA each year, said Tom McPhail of stockbrokers Hargreaves Lansdown.  Currently someone can invest  3,000 each tax year in a cash mini-ISA 4,000 each tax year in a stocks and shares mini-ISAor 7,000 each tax year in a maxi-ISA, of which up to 3,000 may be in cash.  From April next year, that structure will change.  People will be allowed to save up to 3,600 in a cash ISA and up to 7,200 in a stocks and shares ISA, within a higher overall annual savings limit of 7,200.
US spending slow despite rate cut	Motorway crash victim dies	
Search for missing firefighters	Search for missing firefighters	A 14-year-old girl who was on a fairground ride which collapsed - leaving five people in hospital - did not know if she would get out alive.  Zoe Clarke became trapped on the ride at a bonfire display at Melford Hall, Long Melford, Suffolk, on Friday, when the car she was in was crushed.  Zoe, from Glemsford, Suffolk, said: I did not know if I would get out alive.  I just feel relieved nothing worse happened because it could so easily have killed us all.  Zoe recalled how the Hellraiser ride started juddering up and down before it left its tracks, shortly before 2100 GMT at the bonfire night.  We thought it was part of the ride, then it crashed, she said.  The paramedics said I was lucky not to break my legs  Zoe Clarke  The car behind had gone into us and we had gone into the car in front so we were trapped.  My legs were scrunched and the bar was against my chest. The paramedics said I was lucky not to break my legs.  The fire crews had to take out the car behind us so we had more room to breath, then they cut the seat bar off.  Police and officers from the Health and Safety Executive have begun an investigation into the accident. The event has been closed.  Suffolk Police said the injuries to the five people on the ride are not as serious as first thought, and West Suffolk Hospital have confirmed that four of the victims have now been released from hospital  A 20-year-old man is still being treated for leg injuries.  Five people were taken to hospital when the ride collapsed  An ambulance service spokesman said: The ride appeared to have either gone off its rail or off its central hinge.  There were about 30 people on the ride when it came to a sudden halt.  Five people were taken to hospital and they were aged between 17 and 25. Four were female and there was one 17-year-old male.  Paramedics described the ride as a ground-level spinning machine.  About 10,000 people were at the 39th Big Night Out - an annual event at Melford Hall which raises money for charity.
Fresh fall in insolvency numbers	High Street 'feeling the pinch'	Google's shares have passed $700 for the first time, lifted by reports it plans to enter the mobile phone market.  Its stock rose 1.7% to $707 on Wednesday on rumours it is working with US networks Verizon and Sprint Nextel.  While none of the firms have commented, Google is said to be looking at mobile phones that run on its software.  The value of Google's shares have now risen eightfold since they were first floated in August 2004, as its profit growth continues to dazzle.  It is now the fifth largest US company by market capitalisation, worth a total $219bn (105bn), surpassed by only Exxon Mobile, General Electric, Microsoft and AT&T.  'Make a splash'  Analyst Avi Greengart of Current Analysis speculated about how Google would be able to tempt mobile phone networks to use its phones.  If Google is going to make a splash, it's going to have to say [to operators], 'Offer our phone and we'll share the revenue,' he said.  Last month, Google saw its net profit for the three months to end of September soar 46% to $1.07bn, compared with $733.4m for the same period last year.  Google's share price has risen by $100 since then.  The world's most popular internet search engine, Google makes the bulk of its money from advertising.  Last year, it spent $1.65bn buying video-sharing website YouTube.  Google's shares were priced at $84 when they debuted in 2004.
Mills blames Sir Paul for split	Ant and Dec win three TV Awards	Europe's last tin mine could restart production in 2009, 11 years after it closed, says its owner.  Baseresult Holdings Ltd, which bought the South Crofty mine in 2001, has created a new company, Western United Mines Limited (WUM), to operate it.  The firm said it would be spending more than 50m on restarting the mine which closed in 1998.  It said rising tin prices had given the mine, first opened in the late 16th Century, another 80 years of life.  Tin prices 'buoyant'  Mark Thompson, chief investment officer with Galena Asset Management, a partner in the new venture, said: New uses for tin, particularly in lead-free solder, will keep prices buoyant for many years to come and make an investment in tin mining a very attractive proposition.  More than 3.5m would be spent during the next seven months on continuing the mine development.  The further 50m of investment would be required by the time the mine starts production.  County councillor Mark Kaczmarek, who worked underground at South Crofty for 17 years, said the mine would give a real boost to Cornish pride, but added there have been promises made in the past.  Compulsory purchase  Crofty Developments, a partner of the new company, still has to resolve a row with the South West Regional Development Agency (RDA) over use of more than 30 acres of land surrounding the site.  The RDA wants to make a compulsory purchase order on the site for leisure, housing and industry, but Crofty Developments has been fighting in the High Court to retain the site.  Stephen Bohane, head of operations for the RDA in Cornwall, said: We have not yet been able to assess Western United Mines' proposals but look forward to finding out more.  He said the RDA still intended to compulsorily purchase the land around South Crofty, or buy it through negotiation.  Two thousand mines  He said: We would only acquire the surface site, not the mine itself.  Planning policy dictates that mineral reserves like those at Crofty cannot be sterilised by development and that access must be maintained.  We are committed to that and are willing to work with the mine owners to ensure that regeneration of the surface site does not compromise future access to tin.  The Cornish mining industry, which dates back to 2,000 BC, reached its peak in the 19th Century, when deep extractions got under way.  Thousands worked in up to 2,000 mines, before the industry collapsed when ores began to be produced more cheaply abroad.
Indiana Jones thief pleads guilty	Industry reacts to games review	A team of US technicians is due to begin disabling North Korea's nuclear complex on Monday with Pyongyang's permission, a top US envoy has said.  The technicians have left Pyongyang and are due to arrive at the main nuclear site, Yongbyon, on Sunday, according to Christopher Hill.  Pyongyang agreed to disabling in return for aid and security guarantees.  It shut down its reactor at Yongbyon in July and is to give details of its programme by the end of the year.  Speaking in Tokyo, Mr Hill said the US experts would start disabling the reactor, North Korea's only functioning one, and two other facilities on Monday.  It's a very big day because it's the first time it [North Korea] is actually going to start dismantling its nuclear programme, he added.  Two months' work  The team, headed by Sung Kim, director of the US State Department's Office of Korean Affairs, reached Pyongyang on Thursday afternoon via Beijing.  We would like to start as soon as possible, Mr Kim said.  The agreement on disabling came after many rounds of six-party negotiations in Beijing involving China, the US, Japan, Russia and the two Koreas.  Earlier, Mr Hill said he was very satisfied with progress made in preparatory talks with his North Korean counterpart, Kim Kye-gwan.  Kim Kye-gwan confirmed there were no major differences in opinion.  Working in two or three-week rotations over about two months, the US experts are expected to slowly disable the plant, which produces weapons-grade plutonium.  It will be a combined effort, with North Korean help and our experts supervising and co-ordinating, said Mr Kim.
Oprah school employee arrested	Baby escapes firework blast	Two men have been arrested as part of the Financial Services Authority's (FSA) first criminal investigation into illegal share selling.  The two suspects were arrested on Wednesday after police helped the FSA raid several addresses in England.  The FSA suspects the men of involvement with Universal Management Services (UMS), a front for fraudulent share traders known as boiler rooms.  The regulator suspects victims of the fraud may have been conned out of 5m.  Victims  Boiler rooms are usually based overseas but sometimes operate with the help of front organisations in the UK that channel the money abroad.  The FSA has no jurisdiction overseas but tries to close down any boiler room activities here.  The fraudsters involved are not authorised by the FSA and typically sell shares to unsuspecting members of the public by cold-calling them.  It shows we will not hesitate to use our powers to protect consumers, including launching criminal investigations where appropriate  Jonathan Phelan, FSA  Q&A: What are boiler rooms?  They then persuade their victims to buy shares that are worthless or have little value.  The FSA said it suspected that UMS had been helping illegal boiler rooms after it received complaints from the public about the high-pressure tactics of the salesmen, who had told their victims to make out cheques to UMS.  The FSA said UMS, which is unrelated to at least four UK registered companies with similar names, appeared to have been taking payments for at least six known boiler rooms.  Assets worth about 5.5m have been frozen so far as part of the investigation.  This the first time we have taken this action and it shows that we will not hesitate to use our powers to protect consumers, including launching criminal investigations where appropriate, said Jonathan Phelan, head of retail enforcement at the FSA.
Electronic Arts to close UK site	Jail term for Prison Break actor	Thousands of people were expected to take part in a parade through north-west London to celebrate Diwali, the Hindu festival of lights.

Labour 'united despite mistakes'	Why popstars are going it alone	Author Harper Lee is to be given America's highest civilian honour by President George W Bush for her outstanding contribution to literature.  Her only novel, To Kill a Mockingbird, which was a plea for racial tolerance, won the Pulitzer Prize in 1961.  The award will be presented to Lee during a ceremony at the White House on 5 November.  The Presidential Medal of Freedom was reinstated in 1963 by President Kennedy to honour remarkable achievements.  Falsely accused  Past recipients of the honour include Muhammad Ali, Aretha Franklin and Doris Day.  Lee, 81, who stopped giving interviews after winning the Pulitzer Prize, rarely makes public appearances.  The film version of To Kill A Mockingbird, made in 1962, won an Oscar for actor Gregory Peck.  He played laywer Atticus Finch, a lawyer who represented a black man who was falsely accused of rape.  In a rare article published in The Oprah Magazine last year, Lee said that in a society where technology prevails, I still plod along with books.
NHS staff protest against reforms	Employment boosts US economy	A man was killed when his car went into a crash barrier during rush hour on a busy stretch of motorway in Warwickshire.  Emergency crews were called to the M6 between junction four and the Corley Services at 1740 GMT on Friday.  The man, who had been driving a Mini, was confirmed dead at the scene, a West Midlands Ambulance spokesman said.  The southbound section of the motorway between junctions three and four was expected to be shut for several hours.
PS3 network enters record books	Markets mixed on credit concerns	The Tamil Tigers have vowed revenge after the man believed to be their number two was killed in a Sri Lankan air force raid.  The military said SP Thamilselvan was at a meeting with other leaders in a camp when it was targeted on Friday.  There are fears the killing could lead to an escalation of the war with the rebels, who want an independent state for the Tamil minority.  Sri Lanka's government has described the killing as a major success.  The rebels' top leader, Velupillai Prabhakaran, has made a rare public appearance to mourn SP Thamilselvan.  The Tamil Tigers' spokesman, Rasiah Ilanthiriyan, told the BBC the group's response to the killing would be in deeds, not words.  'Surprise'  But the rebel spokesman refused to be drawn on the manner of the retaliation they would take. He said it had to be a surprise.  If we want we can take them one by one, so they must change their hideouts  Defence Secretary Gotabaya Rajapaksa  Have your say - what now?  Thamilselvan obituary  SP Thamilselvan was the head of the rebels' political wing and held an important position in their hierarchy.  In areas they control, the Tigers have declared three days of mourning for SP Thamilsevan and the five others killed in the bombing raid.  SP Thamilsevan's death follows that of another key rebel spokesman, Anton Balasingham, last year.  Sri Lanka's Defence Secretary, Gotabaya Rajapaksa, said: If we want we can take them one by one, so they must change their hideouts.  Mr Thamilselvan was the public face of the rebels  The rebels announced on Friday their police chief, P Nadesan, would replace Mr Thamilselvan. He will also remain in charge of police.  The pro-rebel TamilNet website said the air strike had been carried out in Kilinochchi, the rebels' northern stronghold.  It followed a Tamil Tiger attack on an air force base at Anuradhapura last week which left 14 security forces personnel dead and destroyed eight aircraft.  Observers say the two sides now seem to be gearing up for a major confrontation in the north of the country.  The rebels are fighting for autonomy for minority Tamils in the north and east, claiming discrimination by the majority Sinhalese population.  About 70,000 people have died in more than 20 years of war.
Man killed in motorway accident	Inquiry into Haiti UN sex claims	Some of the Europeans implicated in an alleged attempt to kidnap children from Chad have appeared before a magistrate in the capital, N'Djamena.  Eight of the 17 accused Europeans and three Chadians were questioned in connection with an alleged attempt to fly 103 children out of Chad.  Six of the accused are members of a charity, Zoe's Ark, which claimed the children were Sudanese orphans.  But aid agencies and the French foreign ministry questioned the claim.  The purpose of Saturday's hearing was not explained.  On Friday, 16 Europeans and four Chadians had been flown to N'Djamena from Abeche.  They joined the 17th European, a Belgian pilot who was already being held in a N'Djamena prison.  Questionable claims  The group was detained last week in Abeche as they tried to take to France 103 children they claimed were orphans from Sudan's Darfur region.  However, UN aid agencies and the International Red Cross have said 91 of them came from a home with at least one adult considered a parent figure.  Six workers for Zoe's Ark, the French charity behind the flight, were charged with kidnapping on Tuesday and three French journalists and seven Spanish air crew were charged as accomplices.  If they are found guilty, the main accused could face between five and 20 years in prison with hard labour.  On Thursday Chadian President Idriss Deby said he hoped the three journalists and the Spanish flight crew members could be released soon.
MySpace in Google software deal	Banksy 'caught in the act on film'	The technology behind the wind-up radio could soon be helping to light up some of the poorest homes in Africa.  The Freeplay Foundation is developing prototypes of a charging station for house lights it hopes will improve the quality of life for many Africans.  The Foundation said the lights would replace the expensive, polluting and unhealthy alternatives many Africans currently use to light their homes.  Field testing of the prototypes will start in Kenya in the next few months.  Light and life  Kristine Pearson, director of the Freeplay Foundation, said few Africans in the continents most vulnerable areas had access to electricity to light homes.  Their life stops or is very narrowed when the sun goes down, she said. Two extra hours of light would make a big difference to their life.  The World Bank estimates that more than 500 million people in sub-Saharan Africa do not have access to electricity supplies that could be used to light their homes.  Instead, said Ms Pearson, many used kerosene lamps, battery-powered lights or wood fires as sources of illumination after sundown.  Buying kerosene or batteries can consume up to 15% of a household's budget, said Ms Pearson. In addition wood was hard to gather and unhealthy to burn.  As part of its LifeLight Project the Freeplay Foundation has drawn up designs for a charging base unit that would be able to power up several detachable lights that can be used around a home.  The Foundation aims to train women to sell and maintain the lights  They could use them for study or for safety - to help them if they go somewhere at night, said Ms Pearson.  Working prototypes are now being made that will be tested with families in Kenya to refine the design.  Freeplay technology has already been used to create wind-up torches and small lights said Ms Pearson but the LifeLight Project aims to make bigger, brighter bulbs for homes.  She said the Foundation was adopting a similar approach to that used for the wind-up Lifeline radio to get the lights to families.  Instead of just giving the lights out and then leaving, the Foundation aims to recruit women who will sell the lights and be trained to repair and maintain them for customers.  Ms Pearson said the take up of the lights was likely to be rapid because it would piggyback on the network created by the Foundation to maintain Lifeline radios.  Since it was established in 1998 the Foundation has given out more than 150,000 Lifeline radios.  Ms Pearson said the Foundation had applied for a grant to fund the design and testing work from the World Bank as part of that organisation's Lighting Africa initiative.

PS3 network enters record books	Iraq vows to arrest PKK rebels	Mobile phone provider 3 has launched a new handset that will allow users to make free calls over the internet via telephony service Skype.  Users will also be able to use Skype's instant messaging service, 3 said.  But while people using Skype on their computers are able to make cheap global calls to any phone number, this will not be possible via the new 3 handset.  Skype has about 246 million registered users worldwide and is one of the firms reshaping the global phone industry.  Mobile potential  To date, mobile phone companies have been unwilling to let users freely access Skype via their handsets for fear that it would hurt their business.  While it is possible to access Skype from a number of handsets, this has involved downloading third-party software, something that has put off the majority of users.  The Skype-phone will be the first instance of a phone operator launching a mass market device that is designed to allow free calling over the internet from a mobile, 3 said.  It takes an innovative operator... to challenge traditional thinking and offer the kind of product other operators are still shying away from, said Skype's acting chief executive, Michael van Swaaij.  It's is now truly mobile. Skype has now taken a giant step forward in the mobile arena.  And chief executive of 3 UK, Kevin Russell, said the firm wanted to make mobile internet more accessible.  Services need to be simple to access and affordable, he said.  Mobile has the potential to massively increase access to internet calling.  Global reach  The service, launching on 2 November, will be accessed by a button on the handset.  As well as the UK, the 3 Skype-phone will be launched in countries including Australia, Denmark, Italy and Hong Kong.  Pay as you go customers will have to top up their account with at least 10 each month to qualify for the free Skype-to-Skype calls, 3 said.
Saints issue warning over finance	Intel backs wireless Africa plan	Police in the central Italian town of Perugia have been carrying out a detailed search of a flat where a British student was found murdered.  Meredith Kercher, 21, was found on Friday afternoon with her throat cut in an apartment she shared.  Bloodstains were found in the bathroom and her bedroom door was locked from the inside while her window was broken.  Her father John said he was due to fly to Italy, and the Foreign Office said it was working with Italian officials.  Miss Kercher, from Coulsdon, south London, had been on a study year from Leeds University.  Clues  Police are said to be examining her phone, found in a nearby garden before her body was discovered, and a second phone found near her body.  Police discovered her body in her locked bedroom  Police are also keen to trace an Italian boyfriend and a missing key used to lock Miss Kercher's door.  They also recovered a bloodstained handkerchief from close to the apartment.  Police said Miss Kercher had watched a film at a friend's house on Thursday evening but returned home alone to the apartment she shared with three others.  BBC correspondent Christian Fraser said the door to the bedroom in which she was found had been locked from the inside and it is thought the murderer may have left through a broken window.
Why popstars are going it alone	Industry reacts to games review	Fire officers have briefly entered a Warwickshire warehouse to search for three firefighters missing and feared dead after a suspected arson attack.  The officers spent a few minutes in the devastated building to conduct an initial visual assessment.  One fireman died after being pulled from the vegetable packing plant when the warehouse roof collapsed, but his three colleagues remained inside.  An inquiry into the fire will look at why crews were sent into the building.  Warwickshire police said: The specialist search and rescue team were only able to enter a few feet into the building, where they remained for only a few minutes, to carry out an initial visual assessment of the collapsed building.  Fire officers and police officers at the scene have now withdrawn.  'My worst day'  It said work would resume on Sunday with the assistance of structural engineers and the Health and Safety Executive.  Prime Minister Gordon Brown earlier said he was shocked and saddened while Tory leader David Cameron said it was a reminder of the dangers facing emergency workers.  A Warwickshire fire service statement said: Concerns are heightened hour by hour for the three firefighters who are still missing.  Our worst fears may be realised but we will not give up our search.  Ever-present threat of death  In pictures: Warehouse fire  The gutted warehouse is being treated as a crime scene and police said they believed the fire might have been started deliberately.  Warwickshire's chief fire officer William Brown, speaking at a press conference on Saturday morning, described it as the worst day of my career.  He said an inquiry into the fire would look at why the firefighters were sent into the building.  The whole situation around this incident, the tactics employed by the firefighters while they were there, will be subject to this investigation.  The prime minister said in tribute to the firefighters: My thoughts are with the families of those killed, missing and injured.  I pay tribute to the courage, dedication and service of the firefighters. We stand ready to help in any way we can.  It is believed that warehouse staff were in the building, near Stratford-upon-Avon when fire broke out. An FBU spokesman said crews would have been sent in if more civilians were thought to be inside.  Vegetable packing and distribution firm Wealmoor Atherstone Ltd owns the site, where it employs 300 people.  'Devastated' firm  A spokesman for the company said it was devastated by the death of the firefighter and would cooperate with police and fire investigations into the blaze.  Matt Wrack, general secretary of the Fire Brigades Union (FBU), told BBC News the potential loss of four lives would make the incident the worst loss of life among its members for 35 years.  In 1972, seven firefighters died while fighting a blaze at a warehouse in Kilbirnie Street, Glasgow.  In that incident, one firefighter was trapped inside the building and six of his colleagues died trying to rescue him.

Motorway crash victim dies	Card companies lose refund case	Linda Stein, former co-manager of punk band The Ramones, has been found dead at her Manhattan apartment.  A pathologist said the 62-year-old, who went on to become one of New York's leading estate agents, died from blows to the head and neck.  Stein, the ex-wife of Sire Records head Seymour Stein, managed the Ramones with Danny Fields during their 1970s heyday.  After parting company with the band in 1980, she went into property. Her clients included Sting and Billy Joel.  Long-time friend Sir Elton John told the New York Times he was absolutely shocked and upset.  'Roller coaster'  According to the newspaper, Stein was the model for the agent who tries to sell Charlie Sheen's character an apartment in the film Wall Street.  Born in Manhattan, she worked as a teacher before a blind date with Seymour Stein brought her into the music business.  The record mogul would later tell Vanity Fair magazine their marriage had resembled eight years on a roller coaster, and not always strapped in.  Stein is credited with arranging The Ramones' July 1976 appearance at the Roundhouse in London, thought to be one of the key moments in the creation of the British punk scene.
F1: Hamilton eyes team targets	Labour 'united despite mistakes'	A maternity unit is to reopen after being forced to close in January over fire safety issues.  Fire officers said the ward at Robert Jones and Agnes Hunt Hospital in Oswestry would not last 30 minutes in a fire and access was difficult.  It also closed for six months in 2003 after 22 midwives took leave to have babies before local people mounted a successful campaign to get it reopened.  The first mothers-to-be will be admitted on Monday.  Bridget Poultney, senior midwifery sister, said it was feared at one point that the six-bed unit would close for good.  Treatment available includes antenatal, scanning and postnatal care and use of a birthing pool.
NHS staff protest against reforms	Inquiry into Haiti UN sex claims	Manchester United boss Sir Alex Ferguson accused referee Howard Webb of favouring Arsenal in United's 2-2 draw.  The Gunners twice came from behind to salvage a draw at home on Saturday.  I think Howard Webb has a great chance to be the top referee but today was a big game for him and, at times, he favoured Arsenal, Ferguson told MUTV.  Their second goal came from him not giving a free-kick for a foul on Louis Saha on the far side. It should've been a foul for us.  Interview: Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger  Interview: Man Utd midfielder Ryan Giggs  Interview: Man Utd assistant boss Carlos Queiroz  However, Ferguson stated it was hard for referees not to be influenced by hostile home crowds.  I am pleased that in two big games we had to run after the score and we did that both times  Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger  It is very difficult for the referee, he added. On our bench, we were getting terrible abuse from people two or three feet away from us.  There is a lack of security. It is absolutely disgraceful the abuse you and your staff take. All sorts of things are been shouted and screamed at you and there is an absolute danger here.  However, a spokesperson for the Gunners said: Stadium security is of the highest importance and we feel there is ample stewarding around the dugout area.  However, the club does recognise that some exchanges which takes place can be of an aggressive nature, and there was an incident this afternoon where one supporter was ejected.  There is also CCTV which monitors the area which our stadium management crew review in detail after games, and if necessary the club will take further action.  Ferguson had thought his side had done enough to win the match when Cristiano Ronaldo put them 2-1 up with eight minutes left.  But William Gallas, whose own goal had given United a first-half lead before a Cesc Fabregas goal, volleyed an injury-time equaliser for the Gunners.  606: DEBATE  Arsenal had more chances and had a decent penalty shout waved away  adam_ayres1988  Our character was tested twice, said Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger. Just before half-time and with eight minutes to go.  Overall though, I believe it was a fair result. We played with the handbrake on in the first half, though, and we lacked our usual flowing game.  It was the second time in successive league matches that Arsenal had drawn against top opposition, having finished 1-1 at Liverpool last Sunday.  And Wenger was frustrated not to have taken at least four points from the two games.  That is a disappointment, he added. But on the other hand I am pleased that in two big games we had to run after the score and we did that both times.  We are still in charge of the title race because we are top with a game in hand.
December shoot for X Files sequel	Magistrate quizzes Chad accused	The National Trust has said it would fight the government to protect the countryside from housing development.  Chairman Sir William Proby claimed some 10,000 acres of the green belt is at risk, which he said was terrifying.  The countryside was losing its redeeming and restorative qualities inch by inch, he told the Trust's annual general meeting in London.  The Trust's members are to be asked if it should buy more green belt land to protect it from development.  Prime Minister Gordon Brown has pledged to build three million more homes by 2020 to tackle the housing crisis.  The government says that extra housing is needed to ease shortages, and it can be built while protecting the green belt.  Ministers have said the boom in house building would take place on brownfield sites and areas owned by the public sector.  In his address to the meeting in London, Sir William said plans to build more homes were driven by ministers' obsession with economic growth.  HAVE YOUR SAY  There are still too many undeveloped derelict sites, these should be developed before building on green fields  Adrian, Taunton  Send us your comments  He said more than three square miles of the green belt have been lost each year as a result of regional development plans.  Sir William said: What is happening to the countryside? Inch by inch, year by year its redeeming, restorative qualities are being eroded.  He went on: We are not against progress, nor do we hark back to some mythical golden past. We support the needs of all citizens for decent places to live and we know that some development must happen.  But the sheer scale of what is being contemplated now goes way beyond this.  Sir William told the meeting that new arguments had to be developed to define the benefits that green belt land and open space bring to us all.  He asked members if The National Trust, which has an annual income of 350m, should buy up green-belt areas to protect them instead of relying on the planning system to safeguard the land.  GOVERNMENT HOUSING POLICIES  Housing market renewal scheme to restore sustainable communities to parts of the North and Midlands  Home Information Packs being introduced  All social housing must meet the 'decent homes standard'  100,000 homes in carbon neutral communities planned for old industrial sites  New HomeBuy scheme enables social tenants, key workers and other first time buyers to buy share of a home  Sir William's comments come a week after an independent body set up to advise ministers on new homes said that even the government's projected three million figure would not be enough to meet the demand for new homes.  The government said Sir William's analysis was flawed and that he did not fully understand the planning restrictions in place to protect green-belt land.  A spokesman for the Department for Communities and Local Government said the claims made by Sir William were flawed and misunderstand the planning protections that are in place to safeguard the countryside.  He said: For the sake of first time buyers and families on council waiting lists, there is a need to build more homes but we believe it is possible to do so whilst protecting the environment and green spaces.  The National Trust has 3.5m members, making it one of Europe's biggest membership organisation.  It owns some 250,000 hectares of countryside and 700 miles of British coastline.
Net giants test web health	Google opens up social networks	Russia says the armed seizure of a Ukrainian oil refinery in which it has a stake is a flagrant outrage.  Russian First Deputy PM Sergei Ivanov accused Kiev of inaction after a former head of the Kremenchuk refinery, backed by armed guards, was reinstated.  Pavel Ovcharenko cited a court order returning him control of the refinery.  Kremenchuk's Russian oil supplier - and shareholder - has suspended deliveries, prompting fears of a fresh row between Moscow and Kiev over energy supplies.  The Russian firm Tatneft, based in the Tatarstan region, has a 28.8% stake in the refinery.  The Tatarstan government has urged Ukraine's chief prosecutor to launch criminal proceedings against those who seized the plant.  Russia and Ukraine only recently ended months of dispute by negotiating a deal over the supply of natural gas.  Russian giant Gazprom had been threatening to suspend gas deliveries to Ukraine over alleged unpaid bills.  Ukraine had in turn accused Russia of using energy as a political lever against its pro-Western government.  'Heading for crisis'  Mr Ivanov said on Friday that the dispute over Kremenchuk had harmed greatly the relations between Ukrainian and Russian investors.  He urged Kiev to intervene, saying the Ukrainian authorities' inaction is bewildering.  Armed men entered the Kremenchuk complex on 19 October.  The refinery's boss, Sergei Glushko, was forced from office and its former chief, Pavel Ovcharenko, was reinstated.  The change prompted Tatneft to suspend oil supplies.  On its website, Tatneft says the members of a private security firm had forcibly entered the refinery, battered its guards and briefly corralled board members into a room.  Mr Ovcharenko told AFP news agency the raid had been conducted by bailiffs and had the backing of a court order.  Mr Glushko, quoted by Reuters news agency, said Kremenchuk would stop functioning if it turned to domestic oil supplies and imports from other sources to replace the Russian oil.  Without Russian oil we cannot do anything, he said. Give it a week more and we will be in crisis.
Mum's appeal after son's suicide	NHS staff protest against reforms	An influential group of peers has accused the government of putting its head in the sand after it rejected their ideas for dealing with e-crime.  The Lords Science and Technology Committee report found the internet was the playground of criminals.  But the government did not agree with its suggestion that lawlessness was rife on the internet.  Committee member the Earl of Erroll said the government's response was a huge disappointment.  In its report, the Lords committee criticised the government's Wild West approach of leaving internet security to individuals as inefficient and unrealistic.  Disagreement  It called for the police and criminal justice system to have more resources to catch and prosecute internet criminals.  The peers recommended a central law enforcement agency for reporting e-crime, incentives for banks and other companies trading online to improve data security and the setting up of a kite-mark to identify internet service providers that guaranteed a secure service.  The government does not agree with the implication that the public has lost confidence in using the internet  Government response  And they also argued that steps should be taken to establish legal liability for damage resulting from security flaws found in hardware or software.  But the government made no commitment to accept any of the recommendations.  In a statement, it said: The government does not agree with the implication that the public has lost confidence in using the internet.  The continuing increase of trading on the internet, with year-on-year growth of 80% in some areas, does not support such a view ...  As such, we would refute the suggestion that ... lawlessness is rife.  Business burdens?  The response went on: The government does take seriously all crime committed by use of the internet and agrees with the committee that confidence in the internet is vital.  However, we also feel there is an unwarranted suggestion that [the government's] only response to the problem is to regard it as a personal responsibility of the user to take necessary precautions...  Unfortunately, the government dismissed every recommendation out of hand  Earl of Erroll  Legislation will be kept under review, but the government does not consider imposing additional burdens on business is the best way forward.  The Earl of Erroll said: Unfortunately, the government dismissed every recommendation out of hand and their approach seems to solely consist of putting their head in the sand.  During its inquiry, the committee heard compelling evidence of substantial amounts of e-crime.  We recommended that the government set up a group to develop a scheme for recording all forms of e-crime, the earl said.  The reply just says that the government 'do not see that there is a need for this'. If you have no idea of the scale of the problem, how can you design solutions?
Record payout for sacked worker	Toyota outsells Ford in US market	Filming on the second X Files movie is to begin on 10 December, 20th Century Fox has announced.  The film will see David Duchovny and Gillian Anderson reprise their famous roles as alien-hunting FBI agents Mulder and Scully.  Series creator Chris Carter will direct the as-yet unnamed film when production begins in Vancouver, Canada.  The first X Files feature film was released in 1998 as a spin-off to the successful cult TV series.  Fox also announced the sequel will be released on 25 July 2008 in the US.  'Supernatural thriller'  The script, written by Chris Carter and Frank Spotnitz - who also co-wrote the first X-Files movie - is being kept a close secret.  All that is being revealed is that it is a supernatural thriller and will develop the complicated relationship between Mulder and Scully.  The original cult series was a hit when it ran from 1993-2002, winning three Golden Globes for best TV drama.  The first X Files film grossed $187m (90m) worldwide.
Ant and Dec win three TV Awards	Second man held over terror raid	The new owner of the music group EMI has said some of its artists are not working hard enough and its labels will become more picky in future.  EMI was bought by Guy Hands' Terra Firma private equity house in August for 2.4bn.  In an internal memo obtained by the Financial Times, Mr Hands set out his plans for the future of EMI.  Some [artists] unfortunately simply focus on negotiating for the maximum advance, he said.  Unlike the investment banking world that Mr Hands is more used to in which bonuses are linked to performance, advances are paid to artists regardless of the success of their albums - advances which are often never repaid, the memo bemoaned.  Mr Hands said that eventually it would be open to us to choose which artists we wish to work with and promote.  No specific artists were named in the memo and it added that many spend huge amounts of time working with their label to promote, perfect and endorse their music.  Mr Hands also plans to find better ways to reward executives and encourage them to work together.  He blamed the current situation on a compensation and management system put in place over the last 20 years which does not encourage the right behaviours or reward the right actions.  One of the low points for EMI came in 2001 when it paid 19m to get out of a contract with Mariah Carey, one album into a five album deal.  Ms Carey went on to have one of the top-selling albums of 2005 with EMI's rival, Universal.
F1: Hamilton eyes team targets	Leopard upgrade hits Mac firewall	South African police say they have arrested an employee at US chat-show host Oprah Winfrey's Leadership Academy for Girls on abuse charges.  One girl at the school said she had been fondled; others reported being sworn at, grabbed by the neck, beaten or thrown against a wall.  An internal investigation resulted in a dossier being handed to Gauteng's child protection unit.  Ms Winfrey has twice visited the school at Henley-on-Klip to offer support.  Controversy  Police spokesperson Superintendent Lungelo Dlamini said the 27-year-old woman, a dormitory employee, was arrested on Thursday by the Family Violence, Child Protection and Sexual Offences Unit.  Several charges including alleged assault, indecent assault, crimen injuria and soliciting under-age girls to perform indecent acts are being investigated against her, South African Press Association quotes him as saying.  The girls said they had told the principal, Mbulelo Mzimane, about their complaints but she had failed to act.  The school promptly suspended both the principal and two matrons and offered counselling to its 150 boarders.  Ms Winfrey pledged to build the $40m academy after a meeting with former South African President Nelson Mandela six years ago and she personally interviewed many of the 3,500 South African girls from low income families who applied for the initial 150 places at the school.  The BBC African Service's Nick Ericsson says the school - which is free for pupils - has been no stranger to controversy since it opened its doors in a high-profile launch in January.  Some parents have complained that not only was the academy imposing too many restrictions on their children - with minimal contact being allowed between parents and children - but that junk food was strictly forbidden on the school grounds.
Author Lee to receive US honour	Machinima to go mainstream	Author Harper Lee is to be given America's highest civilian honour by President George W Bush for her outstanding contribution to literature.  Her only novel, To Kill a Mockingbird, which was a plea for racial tolerance, won the Pulitzer Prize in 1961.  The award will be presented to Lee during a ceremony at the White House on 5 November.  The Presidential Medal of Freedom was reinstated in 1963 by President Kennedy to honour remarkable achievements.  Falsely accused  Past recipients of the honour include Muhammad Ali, Aretha Franklin and Doris Day.  Lee, 81, who stopped giving interviews after winning the Pulitzer Prize, rarely makes public appearances.  The film version of To Kill A Mockingbird, made in 1962, won an Oscar for actor Gregory Peck.  He played laywer Atticus Finch, a lawyer who represented a black man who was falsely accused of rape.  In a rare article published in The Oprah Magazine last year, Lee said that in a society where technology prevails, I still plod along with books.
Retired archbishop dies aged 78	Kicking off the free speech debate	Police are continuing to question a man and a woman arrested after a police officer was hit by a car as she tried to arrest the driver.  Det Con Catherine Corbett, 39, of Solihull, remains in a critical condition after the incident in Hayes, west London, on Friday morning.  A man, 41, was arrested in Birmingham on suspicion of the attempted murder of the West Midlands Police officer.  A 32-year-old woman is also being held in London in connection with the case.  Det Con Corbett was trying to arrest a man outside the Sheraton Skyline Hotel, near Heathrow Airport, when he drove off and knocked her over at 0800 GMT.  Police said the officer was hit by the open passenger door as the suspect reversed away from the scene in a blue Peugeot 207.  Fraud inquiry  She suffered serious head injuries and underwent surgery at Charing Cross Hospital's neurological unit on Friday night.  A spokeswoman for West Midlands Police said: She is now out of surgery and everything went well, but her condition is still critical.  Our thoughts and prayers are with Cathy and her family and we are anxiously waiting news from the hospital.  The suspect also crashed into a Ford Focus  A man arrested in Bordesley Green, Birmingham, on Friday, was transferred to a London police station overnight.  A woman was also arrested in connection with the inquiry after she attended a London police station.  Police said as the suspect left the car park the vehicle collided with a black Ford Focus, damaging its front bumper and bonnet.  Two other male officers also suffered minor injuries as they were carried for a short distance on the bonnet of the Peugeot.  The car was later found abandoned in Harlington Road.  Det Con Corbett had been in London for the previous two days as part of a fraud investigation.  Detectives said they had been hunting the suspect for about 12 months.
Kicking off the free speech debate	BA reports strong rise in profits	US games giant Electronic Arts (EA) is to close one of its development sites in the UK as it looks to trim costs.  About 350 jobs will go across the firm worldwide, including the closure of its offices at Chertsey in Surrey.  EA saw a loss of $195m (93.6m) in the three months to the end of September against a $22m profit a year ago, which it said was down to accounting changes.  The firm has been criticised for not investing enough in games for the highly successful Nintendo Wii.  EA's chief financial officer, Warren Jenson, said the company would have seven titles for the Wii in time for Christmas plus five titles for the handheld Nintendo DS system.  We were late to the Wii, but this year, we plan to launch ten to 15 games for the Wii and DS, Mr Jenson said.  Games already released by EA this year include its best-seller, Madden NFL 08, and MySims - part of the successful Sims franchise.  EA, the world's biggest independent games publisher, said that the closure of the Chertsey site would save it between $25m and $30m a year.  Last month it revealed it was to buy two video game studios - Bioware and Pandemic - for $855m in a deal adding role-playing and action titles to its portfolio.
Man in court over schoolgirl gun	The game of love	A project that harnesses the spare processing power of Sony's PlayStation 3 (PS3) to help understand the cause of diseases has entered the record books.  Guinness World Records has recognised folding@home (FAH) as the world's most powerful distributed computing network.  FAH has signed up nearly 700,000 PS3s to examine how the shape of proteins affect diseases such as Alzheimer's.  The network has more than one petaflop of computing power - the equivalent of 1,000 trillion calculations per second.  To have folding@home recognized by Guinness World Records as the most powerful distributed computing network ever is a reflection of the extraordinary worldwide participation by gamers and consumers around the world and for that we are very grateful, said Professor Vijay Pande of Stanford University and a leader of the FAH project.  Disease link  Distributed computing is a method for solving large complex problems by dividing them between many computers.  CELL SPECS  256 billion calculations per second  2.5MB of on-chip memory  Able to shuttle data to and from off-chip memory at speeds up to 100 gigabytes per second,  234 million transistors  The Cell's hard sell  They harness the idle processing power of computers to crunch small packets of data, which are then fed back over the internet to a central computer.  The technique has been used by several groups to study everything from how malaria spreads to searching for new cancer drugs.  One of the most high profile projects is seti@home, which uses computer cycles to search through thousands of hours of radio telescope signals for signs of extra-terrestrial intelligence.  FAH uses distributed computing to examine protein folding and how it maybe linked to diseases.  Proteins that do not fold correctly have been implicated in diseases such as Alzheimer's, Huntingdon's, BSE and many cancers.  Speed test  Until March this year, FAH only ran on PCs.  The program had around 200,000 computers participating in the program, the equivalent of about 250 teraflops (trillion calculations per second).  The addition of 670,000 PS3s has taken the computing power of the network to more than one petaflop.  By comparison BlueGene L, which tops the list of most powerful supercomputers, has a top speed of just 280.6 teraflops.  The boost is in part because of the PS3's powerful processor, known as the cell, which runs up to 10 times faster than current PC chips.  It is clear that none of this would be even remotely possible without the power of PS3, it has increased our research capabilities by leaps and bounds, said Prof Pande.
Second man held over terror raid	High Street 'feeling the pinch'	The number of people being declared insolvent in England and Wales fell again in the third quarter of the year.  The number of individual insolvencies dropped by 3% to 26,072 from the previous three months and was 5% down on last year.  Bankruptcies fell by 2.1% to 15,833, while Individual Voluntary Arrangements (IVAs) went down by 4.3% to 10,239  The number of home repossession orders made by courts in England and Wales also fell by 1% in the third quarter.  In the past three months the total dropped to 23,806.  Consumer borrowing  This is the third quarter in a row that the number of people going bust has fallen, and the first time in five years that there has been a year-on-year decrease.  Pat Boyden of accountants PricewaterhouseCoopers said this drop reflected the fact that borrowing on credit cards has been tailing off.  There has been a fall for the last couple of years, so the insolvency figures have levelled off, he said.  Although bankruptcy levels are still 2.2% higher than a year ago, IVAs are now running 14% lower than at the same stage in 2006.  Lee Manning, an insolvency expert at accountancy firm Deloitte, said that was because firms which specialise in setting up IVAs were having to become more circumspect.  There has been considerable pressure on IVA specialists to be more fussy about the cases they take on, he said.  There have been examples of proposed IVAs that were inappropriate and for which the fees were too high.  Repossessions  Despite the fall in the number of repossession orders that lenders have gained in the courts - the first stage in the repossession process - there have been warnings this week that actual repossessions will rise by about 50% next year.  The Council of Mortgage Lenders predicted that repossessions could rise to 45,000 by the end of 2008, with the number of mortgages more than three months in arrears also going up, by 17% to 170,000.  It said this would be due to homeowners finding it impossible to keep up with rising mortgage payments.  Mark Sands, from accountancy firm KPMG, said this in turn would drive up the personal insolvency figures.  They are both driven by the same factors; the ability to refinance and the pressures on household budgets, he said.  We expect long term that they will go up hand-in-hand with repossessions next year.  Have you been affected by the issues covered in this story?

MySpace casts unknown film stars	December shoot for X Files sequel	Former Prison Break actor Lane Garrison has been sentenced to three years and four months in prison for a drunken car crash which killed a teenager.  Garrison, 27, pleaded guilty in May to vehicular manslaughter, drink driving and providing alcohol to a minor.  The actor was driving his Land Rover in California last December when it left the road and struck a tree. One of his three passengers later died.  Garrison played Tweener in the Fox TV series, shown on Five in the UK.  'Messenger'  Speaking before the sentencing, he said he was sick of his conduct on the night of the crash and felt genuine remorse.  Garrison was found to be two times over California's limit for alcohol in the blood after the accident on 2 December 2006.  The crash killed Vahagn Setian, 17, and injured two 15-year-old girls who were also in the car.  Superior Court Judge Elden S Fox said the public had a right to know that conduct such as this, causing devastation such as this would be punished.  In this case, you have to be the messenger, he told the actor, who was also ordered to pay around $300,000 (144,000) in compensation to the victims and their families.

Barclays shares hit 30-month low	Ramones manager is found dead	
Lavigne takes MTV awards double	Officer 'failed' over fall death	Some of the Europeans implicated in an alleged attempt to kidnap children from Chad have appeared before a magistrate in the capital, N'Djamena.  Eight of the 17 accused Europeans and three Chadians were questioned in connection with an alleged attempt to fly 103 children out of Chad.  Six of the accused are members of a charity, Zoe's Ark, which claimed the children were Sudanese orphans.  But aid agencies and the French foreign ministry questioned the claim.  The purpose of Saturday's hearing was not explained.  On Friday, 16 Europeans and four Chadians had been flown to N'Djamena from Abeche.  They joined the 17th European, a Belgian pilot who was already being held in a N'Djamena prison.  Questionable claims  The group was detained last week in Abeche as they tried to take to France 103 children they claimed were orphans from Sudan's Darfur region.  However, UN aid agencies and the International Red Cross have said 91 of them came from a home with at least one adult considered a parent figure.  Six workers for Zoe's Ark, the French charity behind the flight, were charged with kidnapping on Tuesday and three French journalists and seven Spanish air crew were charged as accomplices.  If they are found guilty, the main accused could face between five and 20 years in prison with hard labour.  On Thursday Chadian President Idriss Deby said he hoped the three journalists and the Spanish flight crew members could be released soon.
Bernard Matthews boss quits firm	Saints issue warning over finance	Waxworks of A-list stars Brad Pitt and George Clooney have undergone emergency repairs after being mobbed by over-amorous fans in London.  Madame Tussauds was forced to withdraw the models just a day after the Ocean's Thirteen attraction opened on Thursday.  Clooney's cheeks had to be retouched when fans left a trail of lipstick marks and Pitt's squeezable bottom was fixed after enduring too many pinches.  The wax figures were back on show on Saturday morning.  A spokesman for Madame Tussauds said while this had happened before, when Johnny Depp appeared as Captain Jack Sparrow in the Pirates of the Caribbean experience, it was quite unusual.  They have been mobbing the whole set, kissing and touching them for a photo, but this is what it is all about so we are not going to stop them doing this, although we will keep an eye on things.  A decision was taken to take the wax figures out of the attraction on Friday morning to allow the studio team to carry out essential maintenance.

Your News	Two arrested in FSA investigation	Iraqi PM Nouri Maliki says Baghdad is ready to pursue and arrest the Kurdish rebel leaders carrying out cross-border raids into Turkey from northern Iraq.  Mr Maliki also said his government would not rule out taking joint action with Ankara against the PKK fighters.  The pledge was made at international talks in the Turkish city of Istanbul on the issue of Iraq's security.  Iraq's six neighbours gathered with diplomats from the UN, G8 and international Arab and Islamic groups.  Attending the one-day conference in Istanbul, Mr Maliki said his country should not be used as a base for attacks against neighbours.  We will co-operate with our neighbours in defeating this threat, he said.  After the talks, Mr Maliki's office said in a statement to Reuters news agency: The prime minister renewed the willingness of the Iraqi government to take steps to isolate the terrorist PKK, prevent any help reaching its members, chase and arrest them, and put them in front of the Iraqi judiciary because of their terrorist activities.  Mr Maliki's spokesman said Baghdad did not rule out joint military action with Ankara, although Iraqi Foreign Minister Hoshyar Zebari stressed such a measure was not imminent.  'Clearly unacceptable'  But analysts say Baghdad has little influence over the semi-autonomous Kurdish regions in the north, and the success of its pledges will depend on the co-operation of Kurdish authorities.  Turkey has massed up to 100,000 troops on its southern border for a possible offensive to eliminate Kurdish rebel bases in Iraq.  Meanwhile, authorities in Iraq have closed an office in Irbil of the Kurdistan Democratic Solution, a political party which Turkey says is a front for the Kurdish rebels.  The party secretary, Fayaq Gulpi, said: The security forces in Irbil entered our office, expelled all our party members and our sympathisers then closed the office.  Irbil is the seat of government for Iraq's Kurdish region, and lies 350km (217 miles) north of Baghdad.  At the Istanbul talks, UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon said attacks launched on Turkish forces from Iraq were clearly unacceptable.  The governments of Iraq and Turkey must work hard to address this challenge and I am confident that a mutually acceptable solution can be found, he said.  Threats  Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan told the meeting: Our objective is to have an Iraq that has stability and safety and that does not create threats for its neighbours.  BBC world affairs correspondent Nick Childs says the Iraqi authorities had wanted the talks to focus on broader questions of security and stability in Iraq, and how the outside world could help.  An earlier round of talks on the same topic was held in Egypt in May, when an agreement in principle was reached to forgive Iraq some $30bn (14.4bn) in debts.  Turkey is pressing Washington to do more to stem PKK activity from Iraq, where the organisation is thought to have about 3,000 rebels based.  On the sidelines of the Istanbul meeting, Turkish Foreign Minister Ali Babacan was expected to hold talks with US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice.  Turkish Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan is meeting President George W Bush in Washington on Monday.
Council 'toughest' over parking	US TV show pulled after race row	Madeleine McCann's mother has appealed for new information about her daughter's whereabouts to mark six months since her disappearance.  Kate McCann said she retained hope that we can be reunited.  She and her husband, Gerry, will mark the day later at an ecumenical prayer service at the Church of St Mary and St John in their Leicestershire home town.  Madeleine, of Rothley, vanished from a holiday apartment in Portugal on 3 May, days before her fourth birthday.  The McCanns, both 39, remain suspects with arguido status in the case, but deny any involvement.  Family spokesman Clarence Mitchell confirmed a Spanish private detective hired by the family, Francisco Marco, had vowed to find Madeleine as quickly as possible.  But he would not confirm newspaper reports that the detective was following up a possible sighting of Madeleine in Morocco.  'Pass it on'  Mr McCann returned to his job as a consultant cardiologist at Leicester's Glenfield Hospital on Thursday, after being on unpaid leave since Madeleine went missing.  He will initially work three half-days a week, and will have no direct contact with patients.  Kate McCann works as a part-time GP in Melton Mowbray but as yet has no plans to return to work.  In a statement to mark the sixth month since their daughter's disappearance, she said: There is no doubt that the best place for her to be is with her family.  We know somebody somewhere can make this happen. That person has the ability and power to bring about so much joy as well as bring peace to themselves.  She urged anyone with information regarding the child's whereabouts to pass it on.  The McCanns also released a new picture of Madeleine, taken a week before her family holiday in the Portuguese resort of Praia da Luz.

Kevin Lewis, 26, from Tranmere in Wirral, worked at Domino's on London Road in Liverpool.  Mr Lewis was sacked when he refused a transfer to a branch in Chester because he could not afford the travel costs.  He was replaced by Polish immigrants who were paid the minimum wage and had accommodation deducted by their boss.  Compensation awaited  An employment tribunal in Liverpool heard three Poles and one Iranian were hired to work at the shop in the city, in September 2006 and paid 5.35 an hour.  Mr Lewis, who was paid 6 an hour, was offered a transfer to another branch, but refused and was later sacked.  Mr Lewis, who is now a youth worker, will hear how much compensation he is to receive next month.  He said his is a victory for British workers.  This is just one case - there could be thousands, he said. I was just treated like I was dispensable.  AKS Partners Ltd, which runs the store, was unavailable for comment.
Mass exodus from Mexico flooding	When work becomes a game	An unexploded World War II mine dredged up off the Kent coast at Margate by a fishing trawler has been blown up.  Dover coastguard said the bomb, which was temporarily mislaid and later found, was made safe in a controlled explosion on Saturday afternoon.  The 15,000lb bomb was dragged up by the Millenia on Wednesday.  Royal Navy divers had to search the sea with sonar equipment after attempts to detonate the mine on Thursday were unsuccessful and it was lost.  The German parachute mine had been placed in a large net, but after the failed attempt it fell out of a hole made by the blast.  A spokesman for Dover Coastguard said all shipping was kept away from the area until the detonation took place.  The process involved a controlled explosion on the sea bed.  Three weeks earlier the same fishing boat caught a similar device, which was made safe in an explosion which was felt ashore and registered with the British Geological Survey (BGS) in Edinburgh.
Fresh fall in insolvency numbers	Virgin dispute hits BSkyB profits	Councillors in Cornwall have begun to prepare for turning the county's local councils into a unitary authority.  Some of the districts had waged a campaign against the single status plan, claiming it would not benefit the taxpayers.  But Cornwall County Council said becoming a unitary authority would eventually save taxpayers 17m a year.  Councillor Graham Facks-Martin said the meeting of the 24 representatives had been constructive.  The councillors represented the county council and six district councils.  Jobs concern  The district councils have waged a campaign against the creation of the controversial single authority - some making claims of it being too centralised and undemocratic.  A unitary authority will be responsible for roads and education, as well as leisure, environmental health and housing.  If unitary status is approved there will be a reduction in the number of councillors.  The public service union Unison has raised concerns about the effect the change could have on jobs.  Subject to legislation the new authority could be up and running in 2009.
Man, 93, dies after car park row	Bernard Matthews boss quits firm	The Queen has visited Pinewood Studios, where she had a sneak preview of the new James Bond set.  She also met with actors on the set of TV comedy My Family and watched a live feature film stunt involving a high speed boat chase.  Accompanied by the Duke of Edinburgh, the Queen also opened a new gateway at the studio in Buckinghamshire.  The James Bond set is being kept under wraps while the film, due out next November, is in pre-production.
Memorial for plane crash victims	Tin mine aims to re-open in 2009	Led Zeppelin's eagerly-awaited reunion concert in London has been postponed for two weeks because guitarist Jimmy Page has fractured a finger.  Originally scheduled for 26 November, the tribute concert in honour of late Atlantic Records founder Ahmet Ertegun will now take place on 10 December.  Page said he was disappointed by the postponement but that it would enable my injury to properly heal.  All tickets for the original show will be valid for the re-arranged date.  Ticket holders who are unable to attend the rescheduled concert have until 1200 GMT on 14 November to apply for a full refund.  The postponement will... permit us to perform at the level that both the band and our fans have always been accustomed to  Jimmy Page  Page was injured last weekend and has been told he cannot play guitar for three weeks.  A spokesman said the band had not revealed which finger was affected or how the fracture occurred.  In a statement put out by the band, a specialist is quoted as saying that, with proper rest and treatment, he will be ready to resume rehearsing around 23 November.  Led Zeppelin have always set very high standards for ourselves, continued Page.  He said the delay would permit the reformed group to perform at the level that both the band and our fans have always been accustomed to.  Led Zeppelin's last full concert was in Berlin in July 1980  Page, singer Robert Plant and bassist John Paul Jones have not played together since 1988.  Pete Townshend, Bill Wyman, Paolo Nutini and Foreigner will also perform at the one-off concert at London's O2 arena.  More than a million fans applied for the 20,000 tickets available, which cost 125 each and were allocated by ballot.  Profits from the show will go towards scholarships in Ertegun's name in UK, the USA and Turkey, the country of his birth.  Page's accident will not prevent him from attending an awards ceremony in London on Monday, when he will be honoured as a living legend at the Classic Rock Roll of Honour.
Woman's body found on beach	Bernard Matthews boss quits firm	Heather Mills has criticised her estranged husband Sir Paul McCartney in a US TV interview - a day after she hit out at the media on British TV.  Mills said she promised Sir Paul she would walk away with nothing in a very gentle and quick divorce if he took the blame for their split.  In an interview on US show Today, she claimed he agreed to take responsibility but did nothing.  Sir Paul's spokeswoman declined to comment.  The couple, who married in 2002, are in the middle of divorce negotiations.  They have a four-year-old daughter, Beatrice.  All I can say is when we first split, I said to Paul: 'I'm going to be crucified. You know why we split. You know the truth. They don't need to know the details, but you need to stand up and say [you are] responsible for the breakdown of this marriage,' Mills told the NBC programme.  The couple's separation has been very high profile  She said Sir Paul was a broken man when she met him and that he was unable to perform on stage.  I was a huge support for Paul. I put all my own work except my charity on hold for the seven-and-a-half years we were together, she added.  The interview followed Mills' emotional outburst on UK breakfast programme GMTV earlier this week, in which she accused the tabloid press of pushing her to the edge.  She said she had received death threats and been close to suicide.  British newspapers were largely unsympathetic, with one tabloid describing her as self-pitying.  Government minister David Lammy told BBC One's Question Time he had found it disturbing to watch the Mills interview.  I did feel actually quite sorry for her. I do think she is a woman very much on the edge, he said.  It was definitely the wrong thing to do  Phil Hall, Heather Mills' former spokesman  It was actually quite disturbing to watch and I hope that perhaps she seeks the right support because it's not nice to see someone who clearly is losing themselves to the media frenzy surrounding them and, in the end, a marriage that is breaking down.  And she does have a child, so I do feel for her in that sense, he added.  Meanwhile, Mills' press spokesman has resigned following her GMTV interview because he felt her public outburst was a mistake.  It was definitely the wrong thing to do, said Phil Hall, who was hired by Mills in 2006 after her marriage split.  I'm very sad about it. We've been through a lot during the last two years and it's a shame, he told the Reuters news agency.  Mr Hall said he had advised Mills to not respond to bad press coverage.  My view is that you need good relations with the media to turn the negative into the positive and I advise always to ignore the stuff thrown at you, said the former editor of tabloid newspaper The News of the World.

MySpace in Google software deal	Lower margins hit Exxon profits	Many stallholders at Bath's Farmers' Market say they are unhappy about plans for expansion.  The local eco-group Envolve has taken over the market and said it wants to attract more traders and a greater variety of products.  But those who currently work on the market say they are worried that the character of the event will be ruined.  There are also fears that they may lose control and be saddled with significant rises in rent.  The market has strict criteria for locally produced goods.  Traders are meeting with bosses next Saturday.
MySpace in Google software deal	Share and share alike	A sacked London park worker has been awarded record compensation of 550,000 because he was the victim of disability discrimination.  The man, who suffers learning difficulties, was unfairly sacked from his job by Lambeth Serviceteam, an employment tribunal in Croydon found.  His compensation comprises loss of earnings until retirement.  He was one of 24 members of the GMB union who had claimed they had been unfairly dismissed.  He was 34 years old when he lost his job.  'Shoddy treatment'  The claimants were all gardeners and had tended parks throughout the London Borough of Lambeth, including Clapham Common.  In total the group was awarded compensation of 1.3m.  Richard Ascough, GMB regional secretary, said he was delighted with the ruling, as his members had been very shoddily treated by the employer after many years of loyal service.  The hearing was told that the employer had used a system for selecting personnel for redundancy which was weighted against disabled workers as it focused on the numbers of days of absence, and whether staff drove a car or not.  A spokesman for the GMB union said the scale of the awards was so large, it was now considering whether to re-open other recent cases involving claims of disability discrimination.  Lambeth Serviceteam has since been bought by Veolia Environment Services Lambeth.
EMI 'artists need to work harder'	Memorial for plane crash victims	Two youths have been arrested after a powerful firework smashed through the bedroom window of a house on Tyneside, narrowly missing a sleeping baby.  The modified rocket, which had a large banger forced into its top, started a small fire at the house in Redewood Close, in Slatyford, Newcastle.  The nine-month-old was showered with glass in her cot, as the missile shattered the double-glazed window.  She was snatched to safety as the room filled with smoke.  Her parents said they believed only the night blind prevented her from sustaining serious injuries.  A spokesperson from the Tyne and Wear Fire and Rescue Service said that combining fireworks to increase their power was a potentially lethal thing to do.
PS3 network enters record books	China raises fuel prices by 10%	Delayed discharges from hospitals - so-called bed-blocking - rose sharply last year, according to figures released in Parliament.  In total, more than a million bed days were lost, with an increase of almost 30% in acute hospitals.  In previous years, incentives for the best-performing hospitals had led to substantial drops across the NHS.  The Patients Association described the figures as avoidable, unacceptable and extremely worrying.  No-one wants to stay in hospital longer than they have to but it is sadly the case that older patients often have nowhere else to go  Gordon LishmanAge Concern  Delayed discharges do not mean that hospitals are taking too long to get patients ready to leave, but are often due to delays in arranging the necessary level of care for patients who are often still heavily dependent following serious illness or major surgery.  In 2005/06, a total of 756,581 bed-days were lost due to delayed discharge in acute hospitals - each bed day meaning a single day in which a bed was unavailable for a new patient because its previous occupant was staying too long.  Last year, this rose to 963,776, an increase of almost 30%.  When delayed discharges from community hospitals - which submitted figures for the first full year in 2006/07 - are added to the total, there were more than a million.  The statistics were released in response to a Parliamentary question by the Liberal Democrats.  They said that the problem was costing the NHS 100 million a year.  Health spokesman Norman Lamb MP said: It's a crazy situation. It's down to a failure to integrate effectively health and social care.  In areas where this remains a problem we expect NHS Trusts working with local authorities to address this issue as a matter of priority  Ivan Lewis MPCare Services Minister  However, the NHS Confederation said it was hard to pin down a single reason for the sharp rises.  Jo Webber, its Deputy Policy Director, said: No one should have to stay in hospital any longer than is necessary.  There may be many different reasons for the increase in the figures; for example, local circumstances such as the supply of care home beds.  Such difficulties will be of concern to both health and social care partners in an area.  She said that the joint working needed between local authorities and hospitals to ensure smooth discharges was a difficult balancing act.  Back to hospital  The vice-chairman of the Patients Association, Michael Summers, said the figures were alarming.  These delays are really avoidable, they're really unacceptable and unfortunately it's happening to a lot of people, he said.  Last year there was an increase in bed blocking by something like 30% and involving almost 50% of NHS trusts, so it's not isolated by any means. It's extremely worrying.  Gordon Lishman, the Director General of Age Concern, said that the figures suggested delayed discharge remained a major problem.  No one wants to stay in hospital longer than they have to but it is sadly the case that older patients often have nowhere else to go, he said.  The NHS and social services have failed to invest adequately in appropriate community services and support, which is leaving it unsafe to discharge some older people from hospital.  He said that the same deficiencies were leading to large numbers of patients having to be re-admitted to hospital because the right support was not in place to help them cope at home.  The Local Government Association said it was unfair to blame local authorities for any increase in delayed discharges.  A spokesman said: These figures clearly demonstrate that health and social care are two sides of the same coin; where you underfund one, you overstretch the other.  Support for services such as social care through the government grant has increased by just 14% in real terms since 1997.  This is in stark contrast to the NHS, which has seen a 90% rise over the same period.  Care Services Minister Ivan Lewis said that over the past six years, there had been a 71% drop in the number of patients having their discharge delayed.  By March 2007, on an average day, just over 2,000 patients had their discharge delayed compared to over 7,000 in September 2001.  In areas where this remains a problem we expect NHS Trusts working with local authorities to address this issue as a matter of priority.
Supply fears puts oil at new high	Arsenal 2-2 Man Utd	Iraqi PM Nouri Maliki says Baghdad is ready to pursue and arrest the Kurdish rebel leaders carrying out cross-border raids into Turkey from northern Iraq.  Mr Maliki also said his government would not rule out taking joint action with Ankara against the PKK fighters.  The pledge was made at international talks in the Turkish city of Istanbul on the issue of Iraq's security.  Iraq's six neighbours gathered with diplomats from the UN, G8 and international Arab and Islamic groups.  Attending the one-day conference in Istanbul, Mr Maliki said his country should not be used as a base for attacks against neighbours.  We will co-operate with our neighbours in defeating this threat, he said.  After the talks, Mr Maliki's office said in a statement to Reuters news agency: The prime minister renewed the willingness of the Iraqi government to take steps to isolate the terrorist PKK, prevent any help reaching its members, chase and arrest them, and put them in front of the Iraqi judiciary because of their terrorist activities.  Mr Maliki's spokesman said Baghdad did not rule out joint military action with Ankara, although Iraqi Foreign Minister Hoshyar Zebari stressed such a measure was not imminent.  'Clearly unacceptable'  But analysts say Baghdad has little influence over the semi-autonomous Kurdish regions in the north, and the success of its pledges will depend on the co-operation of Kurdish authorities.  Turkey has massed up to 100,000 troops on its southern border for a possible offensive to eliminate Kurdish rebel bases in Iraq.  Meanwhile, authorities in Iraq have closed an office in Irbil of the Kurdistan Democratic Solution, a political party which Turkey says is a front for the Kurdish rebels.  The party secretary, Fayaq Gulpi, said: The security forces in Irbil entered our office, expelled all our party members and our sympathisers then closed the office.  Irbil is the seat of government for Iraq's Kurdish region, and lies 350km (217 miles) north of Baghdad.  At the Istanbul talks, UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon said attacks launched on Turkish forces from Iraq were clearly unacceptable.  The governments of Iraq and Turkey must work hard to address this challenge and I am confident that a mutually acceptable solution can be found, he said.  Threats  Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan told the meeting: Our objective is to have an Iraq that has stability and safety and that does not create threats for its neighbours.  BBC world affairs correspondent Nick Childs says the Iraqi authorities had wanted the talks to focus on broader questions of security and stability in Iraq, and how the outside world could help.  An earlier round of talks on the same topic was held in Egypt in May, when an agreement in principle was reached to forgive Iraq some $30bn (14.4bn) in debts.  Turkey is pressing Washington to do more to stem PKK activity from Iraq, where the organisation is thought to have about 3,000 rebels based.  On the sidelines of the Istanbul meeting, Turkish Foreign Minister Ali Babacan was expected to hold talks with US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice.  Turkish Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan is meeting President George W Bush in Washington on Monday.
Man killed in motorway accident	Fire all clear for maternity ward	China has raised fuel prices by almost 10% in an effort to ease the country's worsening supply crisis.  Officials hope the extra revenue will make refiners increase production, easing the long queues and rationing at filling stations.  The rise is a reversal of policy. In September the government promised to keep fuel prices at current levels.  Correspondents warn that the move could add to rising inflation, which is already at record highs.  Centralised pricing  China has long had a system of price controls to prevent inflation and social unrest, according to a BBC correspondent in Beijing, Dan Griffiths.  But Beijing cannot ignore what is happening in the rest of the world, our correspondent says.  Oil prices have been sky rocketing, but Chinese refiners cannot pass those rises on to consumers and so they are losing money.  Many have already cut their supplies to limit losses.  Refiners will only lose less  Na Liu, analyst at Scotia Capital  The National Development and Reform Commission, the country's main planning agency, said the government had decided to increase fuel prices to guarantee domestic refined oil supply and promote energy conservation.  But the commission promised to shield the public from some of the increases.  Prices of railway tickets, natural gas for civilian use and public transportation will not be raised to reduce the impact of the price hikes on the public, the commission said in a statement.  It also added that subsidies would be given to taxi drivers.  Hunting profit  Following the announcement of the increase to fuel prices, China's main oil companies moved to double their imports of diesel and benefit from the extra cash on offer.  Sinopec and PetroChina were reported to be looking for an extra 120,000 tonnes of diesel for November.  However, analysts warned that the companies would still be losing money.  Refiners will only lose less, said Na Liu, an analyst at Scotia Capital.  Any improvement in earnings, no matter how small, was welcomed by investors.  Sinopec's shares jumped 10%, while PetroChina's advanced 4% to a record high.
NHS staff protest against reforms	Inquiry into Haiti UN sex claims	The amount of money saved in Individual Savings Accounts (ISAs) has now reached 208bn, according to figures from HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC).  ISAs, which let people avoid income or capital gains tax on their savings, have shot up in value in recent years.  Their total value has risen sevenfold from 29bn since 1 April 2000.  It means that almost as much is held in ISAs as is owed by people on credit cards and other forms of non-mortgage debt, such as bank loans.  The Bank of England recently reported that such debt in the UK stood at 216bn.  Fresh investment  The increase in the value of ISAs is due to two things.  The first is the investment return on the cash accounts and the stocks and shares in which the savers' money has been invested.  The other factor is the amount of fresh money invested each year, offset by people withdrawing their money to spend or save elsewhere.  For several years, fresh investment was steady, at around 28bn each year.  But in the past couple of years that has risen, to 33bn in the 2006-07 financial year.  New rules  More than 17 million people currently have an ISA account, of whom 13.6 million made fresh contributions last year.  A quite high proportion of the adult population has bought into the tax advantages of using an ISA each year, said Tom McPhail of stockbrokers Hargreaves Lansdown.  Currently someone can invest  3,000 each tax year in a cash mini-ISA 4,000 each tax year in a stocks and shares mini-ISAor 7,000 each tax year in a maxi-ISA, of which up to 3,000 may be in cash.  From April next year, that structure will change.  People will be allowed to save up to 3,600 in a cash ISA and up to 7,200 in a stocks and shares ISA, within a higher overall annual savings limit of 7,200.
Mass exodus from Mexico flooding	X Factor Emily pulls out of show	
Call for less London-centric BBC	Your News	The new owner of the music group EMI has said some of its artists are not working hard enough and its labels will become more picky in future.  EMI was bought by Guy Hands' Terra Firma private equity house in August for 2.4bn.  In an internal memo obtained by the Financial Times, Mr Hands set out his plans for the future of EMI.  Some [artists] unfortunately simply focus on negotiating for the maximum advance, he said.  Unlike the investment banking world that Mr Hands is more used to in which bonuses are linked to performance, advances are paid to artists regardless of the success of their albums - advances which are often never repaid, the memo bemoaned.  Mr Hands said that eventually it would be open to us to choose which artists we wish to work with and promote.  No specific artists were named in the memo and it added that many spend huge amounts of time working with their label to promote, perfect and endorse their music.  Mr Hands also plans to find better ways to reward executives and encourage them to work together.  He blamed the current situation on a compensation and management system put in place over the last 20 years which does not encourage the right behaviours or reward the right actions.  One of the low points for EMI came in 2001 when it paid 19m to get out of a contract with Mariah Carey, one album into a five album deal.  Ms Carey went on to have one of the top-selling albums of 2005 with EMI's rival, Universal.
Chevron sees profits tumble 25%	Your News	Shares in Barclays Bank have fallen to two-and-a-half-year lows amid continuing speculation about funding problems linked to the credit crunch.  The shares fell by 8% to 524.5p at one point but later recovered, closing down 5.9%, or 34 pence, at 537.5p.  Rumours about Barclays first emerged in August when technical problems twice forced the bank to borrow overnight funds from the Bank of England.  Barclays declined to comment but has always denied having funding problems.  In a move designed to allay market fears the bank's head of global retail and commercial banking, Frits Seegers, bought Barclays shares worth almost 700,000 ($1.5m) on Friday.  There are concerns about writedowns and everything else, but the comments Barclays have made to date suggest that is not an issue, as does the fact they are still buying back their own shares, said Ian Poulter at Landsbanki Financials.
MySpace in Google software deal	Brown rejected CGT reform	US games giant Electronic Arts (EA) is to close one of its development sites in the UK as it looks to trim costs.  About 350 jobs will go across the firm worldwide, including the closure of its offices at Chertsey in Surrey.  EA saw a loss of $195m (93.6m) in the three months to the end of September against a $22m profit a year ago, which it said was down to accounting changes.  The firm has been criticised for not investing enough in games for the highly successful Nintendo Wii.  EA's chief financial officer, Warren Jenson, said the company would have seven titles for the Wii in time for Christmas plus five titles for the handheld Nintendo DS system.  We were late to the Wii, but this year, we plan to launch ten to 15 games for the Wii and DS, Mr Jenson said.  Games already released by EA this year include its best-seller, Madden NFL 08, and MySims - part of the successful Sims franchise.  EA, the world's biggest independent games publisher, said that the closure of the Chertsey site would save it between $25m and $30m a year.  Last month it revealed it was to buy two video game studios - Bioware and Pandemic - for $855m in a deal adding role-playing and action titles to its portfolio.
Carillion set to acquire McAlpine	Search for missing firefighters	Oil prices have rebounded, settling at a record closing high in New York, spurred on by investor fears that supplies could be threatened.  Sweet light crude added $2.44, ending at $95.93 a barrel, after hitting $96.05 in earlier trade. London Brent settled $2.36 up at $92.08.  Fears of new UN sanctions against Iran are pushing prices up along with strong demand for oil from developing nations.  Many observers believe crude oil will break through $100 a barrel this year.  News late on Friday that the UN Security Council is looking into drafting new sanctions against Iran Friday as it continues with its uranium enrichment plans raised fears about potential shortages.  'Unknown territory'  Strong demand from developing nations and a weak US dollar are likely to keep pushing prices up, experts believe.  There are also concerns about geopolitical issues such as a possible clash between the US and Iran, and an escalation of hostilities between Turkey and rebel Kurdish fighters based in the northern areas of Iraq.  We are stepping into an unknown area  Ken Hasegawa, Fimat Japan  What is driving oil prices up?  The problem facing oil markets and analysts is that all of the factors are combining to create a high level of uncertainty in the market and this, in turn, is driving prices higher.  Oil prices surged on Wednesday after a report showed domestic US crude stocks fell by 3.9 million barrels last week, worrying analysts who had forecast an increase of 100,000 barrels.  The US is the world's biggest energy consumer and the state of its inventories is a key concern for market watchers.  We are stepping into an unknown area, said Ken Hasegawa, a broker at Fimat Japan, of the latest price spike.  Nobody wants to sell, given the fear of a further rise.  Traders are bracing themselves for further rises  The weakening US dollar which has made oil, priced in dollars, cheaper to buy outside of the US has also fanned the price rises.  The dollar hit its weakest levels against the pound since 1981 on Wednesday.  Other factors supporting prices are concerns about the stop-start violence in Nigeria's main oil producing region and worries about the availability of heating supplies for the US winter.  Fixing denied  Oil producers' body Opec continues to be criticised for not doing enough to restrain prices despite agreeing to lift daily output by 500,000 barrels, an increase which came into effect on Thursday.  A senior Opec official said the organisation was not to blame for the price rises and insisted there was no shortage of capacity in the market.  We never fix oil prices, said Abdullah al-Attiyah, Qatar's energy minister.  It is market-driven and it is out of control.
Queen sees Bond set at Pinewood	National Trust in houses land row	Routine heart transplants have been suspended at a leading hospital after a rise in the early deaths of patients.  This year seven of the 20 adult heart transplant patients at Cambridgeshire's Papworth Hospital - or 35% - have died within 30 days of their operation.  The hospital says the UK average death rate is 10% and its normal rate is 7%.  The Department of Health has advised suspending operations pending a review. Lung transplants and other operations are being carried out as normal.  Quick response  Stephen Bridge, the hospital's chief executive, said: It's expected 10% of heart transplant patients die within 30 days.  We've normally been around 7%, so below the national average.  We would like to reassure everyone this review applies to routine heart transplantation only  Stephen Bridge  What could be wrong?  He said they were talking about comparatively small numbers but it was agreed the Healthcare Commission should undertake an external review to see if there are improvements that can be made.  The Department of Health has responded to this very quickly by sending in a team of independent experts to help us review our heart transplant service, said Mr Bridge.  The review is being conducted to help us identify what, if any, action needs to be taken.  We would like to reassure everyone this review applies to routine heart transplantation only.  Patients informed  ''Various measures have been taken over the last couple of weeks but it was really literally late last week that that trigger point was really exceeded.  Hence, we notified the Department of Health and as part of this very early warning system, clearly, we took the joint decision with the Department of Health, in the patients' safety interest we should call in outside help and suspend the programme.''  Mr Bridge said the last heart transplant had been carried out last week and the seventh patient had died on Monday.  The review, which will last two weeks, will look at the individual case notes of those who died after a heart transplant to check the quality of care and to see if there were any common factors.  It will also look at how care is provided from the patient's first contact with the trust to post-operative care and will ensure the transplant service is linked appropriately to the rest of the organisation.  'Beating heart'  Patients on waiting lists and others affected directly by the review have been informed.  Mr Bridge said that if an emergency were to arise then the medical team could carry out a heart transplant.  A heart valve reconstruction operation televised live from Papworth Hospital and watched by 250 people at the Wellcome Collection in London went ahead as planned on Thursday night.  Last year surgeons at Papworth performed the UK's first beating heart transplant where the organ was kept supplied with blood until it was inserted into the patient.  The hospital is asking patients or relatives with concerns to call 01480 830541.  Have you been affected by this story?

Card companies lose refund case	Saints issue warning over finance	Northern Rock and the Bank of England expect that by the end of the year the Rock will have borrowed 30bn from the central bank, the BBC has learned.  It follows Thursday's news that Northern Rock has already borrowed almost 23bn in emergency funding.  That is roughly 730 for every UK taxpayer and marks a rise of 2.2bn from the week ended 31 October.  Northern Rock has been in trouble since the global credit crunch hurt its business and led to a run on the bank.  To win back investor confidence, the government has guaranteed all Northern Rock deposits and loans.  Bigger problem  We are talking about total public-sector exposure to the Rock of 40bn  Robert Peston, BBC business editor  Rock's loan could surge  The BBC's business editor Robert Peston says this means that the UK taxpayer's exposure to Northern Rock could be much more than currently thought.  The extent of public sector support goes beyond these direct loans, he said.  The Treasury has also indemnified a further 20bn odd of retail deposits, he explained.  So we are talking about total public-sector exposure to the Rock of 40bn - equivalent to around 3% of our entire economy.  And that exposure could become much bigger, as other loans to the Rock fall due for repayment.   Later on Thursday, Mr Peston learned that Northern Rock and the Bank of England were projecting that the firm would have borrowed a staggering 30bn from the Bank of England by year end, he said.  Problem model  The problem facing Northern Rock is that three-quarters of its funding came from wholesale money markets, and when the global credit crunch took hold, its main source of financing dried up.  Simply put, banks were so worried about the problems in the global debt market that they stopped lending to each other, making it almost impossible for Northern Rock to keep operating.  As a result, the lender turned to the Bank of England for emergency funding, prompting the run and its current set of problems.  I don't think the loans will stop growing until a decision has been made about the bank's future  Simon Ward, economist, New Star Asset Management  News of the borrowing from the Bank comes as financial firms Virgin Group and JC Flowers have been looking to acquire Northern Rock.  However, none of the possible bidders is likely to buy the firm without a guarantee that the government-backed loans will stay in place.  Simon Ward, economist at New Star Asset Management, said: I don't think the loans will stop growing until a decision has been made about the bank's future.  Resignation  In the weeks since the bank was first given emergency funding, the firm's chairman Matt Ridley has resigned.  Both he and chief executive Adam Applegarth were criticised by MPs in October about the bank's business model.  But they defended its strategy of borrowing large amounts of money in financial markets that they then lent to house buyers as mortgages.  Northern Rock has declined to comment on the latest Bank of England numbers but has said that former estimates of its loans, using the bank's data, were correct.
Search for missing firefighters	Over-50s get networking website	The amount of money saved in Individual Savings Accounts (ISAs) has now reached 208bn, according to figures from HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC).  ISAs, which let people avoid income or capital gains tax on their savings, have shot up in value in recent years.  Their total value has risen sevenfold from 29bn since 1 April 2000.  It means that almost as much is held in ISAs as is owed by people on credit cards and other forms of non-mortgage debt, such as bank loans.  The Bank of England recently reported that such debt in the UK stood at 216bn.  Fresh investment  The increase in the value of ISAs is due to two things.  The first is the investment return on the cash accounts and the stocks and shares in which the savers' money has been invested.  The other factor is the amount of fresh money invested each year, offset by people withdrawing their money to spend or save elsewhere.  For several years, fresh investment was steady, at around 28bn each year.  But in the past couple of years that has risen, to 33bn in the 2006-07 financial year.  New rules  More than 17 million people currently have an ISA account, of whom 13.6 million made fresh contributions last year.  A quite high proportion of the adult population has bought into the tax advantages of using an ISA each year, said Tom McPhail of stockbrokers Hargreaves Lansdown.  Currently someone can invest  3,000 each tax year in a cash mini-ISA 4,000 each tax year in a stocks and shares mini-ISAor 7,000 each tax year in a maxi-ISA, of which up to 3,000 may be in cash.  From April next year, that structure will change.  People will be allowed to save up to 3,600 in a cash ISA and up to 7,200 in a stocks and shares ISA, within a higher overall annual savings limit of 7,200.
F1: Hamilton eyes team targets	China raises fuel prices by 10%	Two youths have been arrested after a powerful firework smashed through the bedroom window of a house on Tyneside, narrowly missing a sleeping baby.  The modified rocket, which had a large banger forced into its top, started a small fire at the house in Redewood Close, in Slatyford, Newcastle.  The nine-month-old was showered with glass in her cot, as the missile shattered the double-glazed window.  She was snatched to safety as the room filled with smoke.  Her parents said they believed only the night blind prevented her from sustaining serious injuries.  A spokesperson from the Tyne and Wear Fire and Rescue Service said that combining fireworks to increase their power was a potentially lethal thing to do.

House price falls 'don't matter'	Employment boosts US economy	Africa needs to embrace wireless broadband as a potential solution to the digital divide, the chairman of Intel Craig Barrett has said.  It's cheaper, easier and more efficient to communicate wirelessly, he told the BBC News website.  Less than 1% of Africans have access to broadband and only 4% use the net.  The International Telecommunications Union has predicted that the Intel-backed Wimax system could become the dominant mobile standard in Africa.  The continent's geography and political barriers have made it difficult to roll out wired broadband.  There is a shortage of fibre cable links between African countries and very few states have extensive copper wire networks for ADSL broadband.  Mr Barrett, who is in Africa as part of the Intel World Ahead programme, said: In every African country, except some of the more established economies, cell phones vastly outnumber fixed line phones.  You always have to put the backhaul channels in - which is why you need an overlaid fibre network.  Mobile connections are far more prevalent in Africa than landlines  Once you have that, forget about wires and twisted copper and go directly to broadband wireless technologies like WiMax.  Wimax is a long range, low power wireless broadband system which can be used to connect PCs and laptops, and in the future mobile phones, to a broadband network.  One internet consultant working in Africa on improving access to broadband, told BBC News that many countries had little choice but to adopt a wireless solution.  Nigeria doesn't have much choice about skipping to Wireless, there is only one way to connect to the net and that is using wireless technologies.  There is absolutely no copper to speak of.  In Nigeria many people access cell phone networks and wireless broadband by purchasing pre-paid scratch cards.  Users can pay up to $300 for a modem and about $200 for a 30-day scratch card, he said.  Despite the improving access to internet technology the cost for wireless technologies remains a barrier to all but a few in Africa, the consultant said.  Wimax is one of several competing technologies, which include Wibro and Ultra Mobile Broadband.  I don't think it's counterproductive to have our hand in more than one effort  Craig Barrett, Intel  Mr Barrett said Africa would not lose out if Wimax were not adopted more widely around the world.  There are always those issues with any technology.  We first started to give demonstrations of Wimax a couple of years ago. There are over 400 trial implementations around the world today and 100 commercial implementations.  According to the ITU, Wimax networks are currently being employed in nine countries in Africa.  Intel, in conjunction with Microsoft, has also begun the shipment of 150,000 laptops to Libya.  Intel has produced a rugged laptop designed for the developing world, called the Classmate PC.  The firm is also backing other efforts, such as the One Laptop Per Child XO machine and the Asus EEE PC.  I don't think it's counterproductive to have our hand in more than one effort, said Mr Barrett.  There are different education models associated with the different forms of hardware. We are a bit agnostic on which piece of hardware to support.  It's more important to know the education model.  Are you affected by the story? What is your experience of using internet in Africa?

Call for less London-centric BBC	December shoot for X Files sequel	Author Harper Lee is to be given America's highest civilian honour by President George W Bush for her outstanding contribution to literature.  Her only novel, To Kill a Mockingbird, which was a plea for racial tolerance, won the Pulitzer Prize in 1961.  The award will be presented to Lee during a ceremony at the White House on 5 November.  The Presidential Medal of Freedom was reinstated in 1963 by President Kennedy to honour remarkable achievements.  Falsely accused  Past recipients of the honour include Muhammad Ali, Aretha Franklin and Doris Day.  Lee, 81, who stopped giving interviews after winning the Pulitzer Prize, rarely makes public appearances.  The film version of To Kill A Mockingbird, made in 1962, won an Oscar for actor Gregory Peck.  He played laywer Atticus Finch, a lawyer who represented a black man who was falsely accused of rape.  In a rare article published in The Oprah Magazine last year, Lee said that in a society where technology prevails, I still plod along with books.
PC stripper helps spam to spread	PS3 network enters record books	Some of the Europeans implicated in an alleged attempt to kidnap children from Chad have appeared before a magistrate in the capital, N'Djamena.  Eight of the 17 accused Europeans and three Chadians were questioned in connection with an alleged attempt to fly 103 children out of Chad.  Six of the accused are members of a charity, Zoe's Ark, which claimed the children were Sudanese orphans.  But aid agencies and the French foreign ministry questioned the claim.  The purpose of Saturday's hearing was not explained.  On Friday, 16 Europeans and four Chadians had been flown to N'Djamena from Abeche.  They joined the 17th European, a Belgian pilot who was already being held in a N'Djamena prison.  Questionable claims  The group was detained last week in Abeche as they tried to take to France 103 children they claimed were orphans from Sudan's Darfur region.  However, UN aid agencies and the International Red Cross have said 91 of them came from a home with at least one adult considered a parent figure.  Six workers for Zoe's Ark, the French charity behind the flight, were charged with kidnapping on Tuesday and three French journalists and seven Spanish air crew were charged as accomplices.  If they are found guilty, the main accused could face between five and 20 years in prison with hard labour.  On Thursday Chadian President Idriss Deby said he hoped the three journalists and the Spanish flight crew members could be released soon.
PS3 network enters record books	Hunters mark start of the season	A team of US technicians is due to begin disabling North Korea's nuclear complex on Monday with Pyongyang's permission, a top US envoy has said.  The technicians have left Pyongyang and are due to arrive at the main nuclear site, Yongbyon, on Sunday, according to Christopher Hill.  Pyongyang agreed to disabling in return for aid and security guarantees.  It shut down its reactor at Yongbyon in July and is to give details of its programme by the end of the year.  Speaking in Tokyo, Mr Hill said the US experts would start disabling the reactor, North Korea's only functioning one, and two other facilities on Monday.  It's a very big day because it's the first time it [North Korea] is actually going to start dismantling its nuclear programme, he added.  Two months' work  The team, headed by Sung Kim, director of the US State Department's Office of Korean Affairs, reached Pyongyang on Thursday afternoon via Beijing.  We would like to start as soon as possible, Mr Kim said.  The agreement on disabling came after many rounds of six-party negotiations in Beijing involving China, the US, Japan, Russia and the two Koreas.  Earlier, Mr Hill said he was very satisfied with progress made in preparatory talks with his North Korean counterpart, Kim Kye-gwan.  Kim Kye-gwan confirmed there were no major differences in opinion.  Working in two or three-week rotations over about two months, the US experts are expected to slowly disable the plant, which produces weapons-grade plutonium.  It will be a combined effort, with North Korean help and our experts supervising and co-ordinating, said Mr Kim.
Man versus machine	Saints issue warning over finance	The number of people being declared insolvent in England and Wales fell again in the third quarter of the year.  The number of individual insolvencies dropped by 3% to 26,072 from the previous three months and was 5% down on last year.  Bankruptcies fell by 2.1% to 15,833, while Individual Voluntary Arrangements (IVAs) went down by 4.3% to 10,239  The number of home repossession orders made by courts in England and Wales also fell by 1% in the third quarter.  In the past three months the total dropped to 23,806.  Consumer borrowing  This is the third quarter in a row that the number of people going bust has fallen, and the first time in five years that there has been a year-on-year decrease.  Pat Boyden of accountants PricewaterhouseCoopers said this drop reflected the fact that borrowing on credit cards has been tailing off.  There has been a fall for the last couple of years, so the insolvency figures have levelled off, he said.  Although bankruptcy levels are still 2.2% higher than a year ago, IVAs are now running 14% lower than at the same stage in 2006.  Lee Manning, an insolvency expert at accountancy firm Deloitte, said that was because firms which specialise in setting up IVAs were having to become more circumspect.  There has been considerable pressure on IVA specialists to be more fussy about the cases they take on, he said.  There have been examples of proposed IVAs that were inappropriate and for which the fees were too high.  Repossessions  Despite the fall in the number of repossession orders that lenders have gained in the courts - the first stage in the repossession process - there have been warnings this week that actual repossessions will rise by about 50% next year.  The Council of Mortgage Lenders predicted that repossessions could rise to 45,000 by the end of 2008, with the number of mortgages more than three months in arrears also going up, by 17% to 170,000.  It said this would be due to homeowners finding it impossible to keep up with rising mortgage payments.  Mark Sands, from accountancy firm KPMG, said this in turn would drive up the personal insolvency figures.  They are both driven by the same factors; the ability to refinance and the pressures on household budgets, he said.  We expect long term that they will go up hand-in-hand with repossessions next year.  Have you been affected by the issues covered in this story?

Barclays shares hit 30-month low	Leopard upgrade hits Mac firewall	Police have arrested a second man in connection with a fatal stabbing in a block of flats.  Neil Hampson, 32, was attacked on a landing at Havre Tower in the Weston area of Southampton, Hampshire, in the early hours and later died in hospital.  A search for a suspect ended when a 27-year-old man was arrested in Bournemouth, Dorset.  Another man, aged 25 and from Southampton, had already been arrested on suspicion of murder.  Mr Hampson, a single man from the Merryoak area of Southampton, died at the city's general hospital and a murder investigation, codenamed Operation Wycliffe, was launched.  Manhunt  A Hampshire Constabulary spokesperson said a fight broke out on the landing outside a 12th floor flat.  Earlier a manhunt was launched to find a suspect who escaped the scene in a stolen car.  Dorset Police helicopter, dog and firearms officers were drafted in to help with the search.  The stolen car was found shortly before 0800 GMT in Bournemouth.  Mr Hampson's next-of-kin have been informed and a post-mortem examination is expected to be carried out later.  The area outside the flats was cordoned off while crime scene officers investigate.  Det Insp Darren O'Callaghan, from the major crime team, reassured residents it was an isolated incident.
Net giants test web health	Intel backs wireless Africa plan	Gold prices ended lower in New York, after hitting a 27-year high, prompted by high oil prices and the weak dollar.  Gold spot prices fell $1.60 to $793.70 an ounce after hitting $799.30 in East Asia trading, its highest since 1980.  Gold prices typically echo movements in oil, as investors see it as a haven against the inflation risk caused by higher crude costs.  Crude oil in New York which had breached $96-a-barrel a barrier earlier, also ended the day lower.  The weakening greenback in recent days had made commodities including gold a more attractive investment, say analysts.  'Complete scenario'  Gold prices have now risen 25% since August.  High crude oil prices mean high gold prices, and in addition to this you have the weak dollar which completes the scenario for a bull run, said Koji Suzuki, market analyst at Kazaka Commodity.  Gold hit an all-time high of $850 an ounce in January 1980, when investors rushed to buy the metal in the face of high inflation sparked by strong oil prices, the impact of the Iranian revolution, and Soviet intervention in Afghanistan.  After adjusting for inflation, that 1980 price is equal to $2,079 today.
Jail term for Prison Break actor	Officers hurt in police car crash	US oil giant Exxon Mobil has seen a 10% drop in quarterly profits, prompted by lower refining margins.  Exxon Mobil said profits had fallen to $9.41bn (4.5bn), in the three months to September, from $10.49bn in the same period last year.  It is the first time since 2002 that Exxon profits have fallen for two quarters in a row.  Energy firms including ConocoPhillips and BP have also seen quarterly profits fall even as oil prices have surged.  Earnings at Exxon's refining and marketing business fell 27% from a year earlier, dropping to $2bn.  There's a real bloodbath in refining margins right now, and that will largely offset the higher upstream earnings, said analyst Lysle Brinker at John Herold.  But despite this, Exxon's overall revenue for the period hit a record at $102.3bn, an increase from $99.59bn in last year's third quarter.  And looking ahead the firm said is aggressively seeking new sources of hydrocarbons.  During the third quarter the firm spent $5.4bn on capital and exploration schemes, marking an 8% rise year-on-year.  The latest figures are a reversal of huge profits seen earlier this year, when it saw the highest profit recorded for a US firm with a 2006 net profit of $39.5bn.
Italian police seek murder clues	Why popstars are going it alone	Police in the central Italian town of Perugia have been carrying out a detailed search of a flat where a British student was found murdered.  Meredith Kercher, 21, was found on Friday afternoon with her throat cut in an apartment she shared.  Bloodstains were found in the bathroom and her bedroom door was locked from the inside while her window was broken.  Her father John said he was due to fly to Italy, and the Foreign Office said it was working with Italian officials.  Miss Kercher, from Coulsdon, south London, had been on a study year from Leeds University.  Clues  Police are said to be examining her phone, found in a nearby garden before her body was discovered, and a second phone found near her body.  Police discovered her body in her locked bedroom  Police are also keen to trace an Italian boyfriend and a missing key used to lock Miss Kercher's door.  They also recovered a bloodstained handkerchief from close to the apartment.  Police said Miss Kercher had watched a film at a friend's house on Thursday evening but returned home alone to the apartment she shared with three others.  BBC correspondent Christian Fraser said the door to the bedroom in which she was found had been locked from the inside and it is thought the murderer may have left through a broken window.

Oprah school employee arrested	Electronic Arts to close UK site	Pakistan's President Pervez Musharraf has defended his decision to declare emergency rule, saying he could not allow the country to commit suicide.  In a televised address he said Pakistan had reached a crisis brought about by militant violence and a judiciary which had paralysed the government.  The chief justice has been replaced and the Supreme Court surrounded by troops.  The moves came as the Supreme Court was due to rule on the legality of Gen Musharraf's October election victory.  The court was to decide whether Gen Musharraf was eligible to run for re-election last month while remaining army chief.  The BBC's Barbara Plett reports from Islamabad that fears had been growing in the government that the Supreme Court ruling could go against Gen Musharraf.  Profile: Pervez Musharraf  Reaction in quotes  Former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto, who recently returned to the country after years of self-exile to lead her party in planned parliamentary elections, was in Dubai on a personal visit when news of the declaration broke.  However, she immediately flew back to Karachi where she condemned Gen Musharraf's decision.  It not clear whether the parliamentary elections due in January will go ahead. Gen Musharraf made no mention of them in his speech, but he insisted he wanted to restore democracy.  Suicide warning  Pakistan has been engulfed in political upheaval in recent months, and the security forces have suffered a series of blows from pro-Taleban militants opposed to Gen Musharraf's support for the US-led war on terror.  In a lengthy televised speech late on Saturday, Mr Musharraf said the situation had forced him into making some very painful decisions.  In pictures: Emergency rule  Declaration: Full text  I suspect that Pakistan's sovereignty is in danger unless timely action is taken, he said.  He insisted his decisions were made for the benefit of Pakistan.  Extremists are roaming around freely in the country, and they are not scared of law-enforcement agencies, the president said.  As well as defending emergency rule to the Pakistani people, Gen Musharraf also appealed directly to his Western allies for patience.  Kindly understand the criticality of the situation in Pakistan and around Pakistan. Pakistan is on the verge of destabilisation, he said.  Inaction at this moment is suicide for Pakistan and I cannot allow this country to commit suicide.  US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice said the declaration of emergency rule was highly regrettable and called upon Pakistan to have free and fair elections.  UK Foreign Secretary David Miliband also expressed concern, saying it was vital Pakistan's government abides by the commitment to hold free and fair elections on schedule.  New chief justice  Gen Musharraf's address echoed the text of the declaration of emergency rule, which opens with a reference to the grave threat posed by the visible ascendancy in the activities of extremists and incidents of terrorist attacks.  Benazir Bhutto returned to Pakistan in response to the news  It ends by saying that the constitution is in abeyance - which, according to our correspondent, in effect means that martial law has been imposed, although there is not a heavy security presence on the streets.  The political and judicial core of Islamabad has been shut down, but the rest of the city is functioning normally, our correspondent says.  She says it is clear from reading the emergency proclamation that the main target is the judiciary which is accused of interfering in government policy and weakening the struggle against terrorism.  Chief Justice Iftikhar Chaudhry and eight other judges refused to endorse the emergency order, declaring it unconstitutional, resulting in Mr Chaudhry's dismissal.  A new chief justice has been appointed, officials say. He is Supreme Court judge Abdul Hameed Dogar, a supporter of Gen Musharraf who was a member of the special tribunal appointed to investigate allegations of wrongdoing by Mr Chaudhry.  Ms Bhutto's return from self-imposed exile last month came about with the co-operation of Gen Musharraf.  Our correspondent says that in the changed circumstances she will have to decide whether she is returning to lead the opposition against the president, or should wait on the sidelines in the hopes of securing an agreement with him.

Author Lee to receive US honour	Second man held over terror raid	Russia says the armed seizure of a Ukrainian oil refinery in which it has a stake is a flagrant outrage.  Russian First Deputy PM Sergei Ivanov accused Kiev of inaction after a former head of the Kremenchuk refinery, backed by armed guards, was reinstated.  Pavel Ovcharenko cited a court order returning him control of the refinery.  Kremenchuk's Russian oil supplier - and shareholder - has suspended deliveries, prompting fears of a fresh row between Moscow and Kiev over energy supplies.  The Russian firm Tatneft, based in the Tatarstan region, has a 28.8% stake in the refinery.  The Tatarstan government has urged Ukraine's chief prosecutor to launch criminal proceedings against those who seized the plant.  Russia and Ukraine only recently ended months of dispute by negotiating a deal over the supply of natural gas.  Russian giant Gazprom had been threatening to suspend gas deliveries to Ukraine over alleged unpaid bills.  Ukraine had in turn accused Russia of using energy as a political lever against its pro-Western government.  'Heading for crisis'  Mr Ivanov said on Friday that the dispute over Kremenchuk had harmed greatly the relations between Ukrainian and Russian investors.  He urged Kiev to intervene, saying the Ukrainian authorities' inaction is bewildering.  Armed men entered the Kremenchuk complex on 19 October.  The refinery's boss, Sergei Glushko, was forced from office and its former chief, Pavel Ovcharenko, was reinstated.  The change prompted Tatneft to suspend oil supplies.  On its website, Tatneft says the members of a private security firm had forcibly entered the refinery, battered its guards and briefly corralled board members into a room.  Mr Ovcharenko told AFP news agency the raid had been conducted by bailiffs and had the backing of a court order.  Mr Glushko, quoted by Reuters news agency, said Kremenchuk would stop functioning if it turned to domestic oil supplies and imports from other sources to replace the Russian oil.  Without Russian oil we cannot do anything, he said. Give it a week more and we will be in crisis.

Police said Miss Kercher had watched a film at a friend's house on Thursday evening but returned home alone to the apartment she shared with three others.  BBC correspondent Christian Fraser said the door to the bedroom in which she was found had been locked from the inside and it is thought the murderer may have left through a broken window.

Two sailors start 4,000-mile race	Overcoming your virtual fears	Late-night TV chat shows seem likely to be the first victims of a strike by the US screenwriters' union, which has been called over royalty payments.  The Writers Guild of America has asked its 12,000 members to stop working and set up picket lines from Monday.  It wants more cash for work which goes on new media such as DVDs or online.  Shows hosted by stars such as Jay Leno, David Letterman and Jon Stewart are expected to stop almost immediately as they rely on a supply of topical jokes.  They call it the toughest time for comedy writing since those three weeks back in the 1990s when Bill Clinton stopped dating  Talk show host Jay Leno  It was anticipated NBC would broadcast repeats of Leno's programme, The Tonight Show, plus Late Night with Conan O'Brien and Saturday Night Live from Monday if the walkout went ahead, the Hollywood Reporter said.  It also said old episodes of The Daily Show and The Colbert Report would be screened under contingency plans by the Comedy Central channel.  But as yet it was unclear what other networks intended to do, it added.  Leno made a quip about the strike on-air on Friday, saying: They call it the toughest time for comedy writing since those three weeks back in the 1990s when Bill Clinton stopped dating. Remember that?  Filling the gaps  The last such action, in 1988, disrupted the autumn television season.  At that time, Letterman was host of NBC's Late Night, and his programme was taken off-air at first. It did return before the end of the 22-week strike, however, but many other shows remained unbroadcast.  Satirical show The Colbert Report is set to be among the casualties  It is anticipated daytime TV output, such as chat shows and soap operas, would be next to suffer if this month's walkout goes ahead. These series are typically recorded about a week in advance of transmission.  The strike would not immediately impact production of film or primetime TV programmes, the Associated Press reported.  This was because most movie studios had already kept aside a number of scripts, and many high-profile TV dramas and comedies had enough scripts or completed shows to last until early next year.  But then Hollywood analysts do expect the supply of shows such as Desperate Housewives, Ugly Betty and CSI to fizzle out, and many writers fear the TV networks will turn to additional repeats and reality programmes to fill the resulting gaps.  Further negotiations  The studios and the union will meet on Sunday morning for last-ditch talks at a neutral venue.  Writers are demanding an increase in the fees they receive when their work is reproduced on DVDs, and a better share of revenue derived from content on the internet, mobile phones and other electronic devices.  Writers have been taking their protest to the streets of New York  But producers have rejected their demands as unworkable.  This led to Letterman calling producers cowards, cutthroats and weasels on his CBS show on Thursday.  Michael Winship, president of the WGA on the East Coast, said there was still time to prevent the walkout, adding: We urge the studios to come back and bargain fairly.  Nick Counter, president of the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers, said the studios were ready to meet and finish negotiations over the weekend.  Earlier, Mr Counter had said no progress was possible for overriding business reasons as long as writers insisted on increasing royalties from DVD sales.  The DVD issue is a roadblock to these negotiations, he added.  We asked for your views on this story. Here is a selection of the responses received.  I have screenplays registered with the Writer's Guild of America West, so I can have the additional protection when pushing my work overseas, mainly in Japan as a backdoor, so I can get into the USA. I think the MBA (Minimum Usage Agreement) is a poor man's farce, plus what a writer has to do just to achieve entry into the Guild is nearly beyond belief. But on the other side, the amount of cut-throat dishonesty that exists among leading industry producers is much worse. Without the Guild's protection we really would have nothing. Given the global economy in which all mediums compete with everything, a larger royalty belongs to the writers. And let's not forget the overcost of for-profit health care in America that the Guild provides to writers as a benefit. This is always left out of the equation. It's not a benefit, when in reality we are fighting for our lives against a for-profit health care system that's against all of us. I fully support all the writers' efforts as one. But as a free agent, I will continue.Alan Colosi, Boston, Massachusetts  As one of the very few British members of the Writers Guild of America (West), I'm saddened by the Producers' attitude in this negotiation. This is a New Century, and a different world we live in. The Internet has helped change the fabric of our existence, and the WGA Membership are seriously taking new distribution methods for our created material into account now...our livelihoods depend upon it. I believe our Guild have the grim resolve to push this unfortunate strike, until we're finally given a fair piece of the pie we're so instrumental in baking. Be warned, Mr Counter: we're unlikely to cave as readily today as we did nearly two decades ago... Peter Briggs, Los Angeles, California & London, UK  I have been writing these worthless scripts for years. I am actually pleased there will be a strike. Not necessarily for better royalties. I think it will give people a chance to reflect upon the mind-numbing quality of what we are churning out. Andrew Johnston, Evreeware, California  This isn't just about the writers, it affects everyone in this town... from the make-up artists to the production assistants just starting out. People think that it's just rich writers being affected, but they are way off. This town thrives on this industry and the fact that the rich execs wont pay a fair rate to those that deserve it blows my mind. The big issue here is that this is just the start. The contracts with the Directors Guild (DGA) and Screen Actors Guild (SAG) will also be facing this same issue in a few months, so they better figure out something... quick!David Tobin, Hollywood, California  The bright side is that maybe unknown writers like me will be able to get their work noticed out of sheer desperation. Hopefully they will find the talented, unnoticed writers that were unable to get their scripts noticed.Daniel Tokle, Lakewood, Callifornia  Daniel - on behalf of my fellow members of the WGA, I want to remind you that if you submit materials to the signatory studios and production shops during a strike, your action will effectively ban you from joining the WGA, thereby stopping your prospective writing career before it has even begun. JK, New York, New York  I applaud David Letterman's description of the producers as cowards, cutthroats and weasels. But he *was* reading it off the autocue.PedroC, UK  I am a British writer who also works in LA and am a member of the WGA. It may seem to people outside the industry that it's one priviliged group whingeing at another. Apart from the fact that many, if not most, writers struggle to make a living, what's at stake is an erosion of the fundamental right to be paid fairly for the work you do. To put fair share into context: the writer's royalty from a $10 DVD is four cents. The studios have been trying to reduce this!Mark Burton, Reading, UK  Actually, Mark Burton's number is inaccurate - the writer's royalty from a $10 DVD would be TWO cents. It's FOUR cents on a $20 DVD. Which is less than it costs to wrap the thing in plastic.Stephen, Los Angeles, California  It's not like the trash collectors are going on strike, which would have a devastating affect on our lives. It's hard to take someone seriously who produces nothing that society needs.Frank Nelk, Boston, Massachusetts  Writers have always been second-class citizens in Hollywood, viewed as little more than the help. How pathetic is it that Letterman and Leno make millions per year, but if the writers walk out they have to shut it down? Must be nice to earn that much off the work of others...JB, Palmetto, Florida  About time we had a clearout of these mind-numbing shows which are endless unoriginal commercials puntuated by a few minutes of dialogue. Only a few are worth preserving but even they get crass after a few episodes. Hope the strike goes on forever, then we might get a rethink of how to entertain!Bob, Spring, Texas
Leopard upgrade hits Mac firewall	Lavigne takes MTV awards double	Around 15,000 Standard Life customers could be at risk of fraud after their personal details were lost by HM Revenue & Customs (HMRC).  The data was on a CD sent from the Revenue office in Newcastle to the company's headquarters in Edinburgh.  But the disc containing names, national insurance numbers, dates of birth and pension data never arrived at its intended destination.  HMRC and Standard Life have warned those at risk to be vigilant.  How the breach occurred  The Revenue routinely sends CDs containing personal data on taxpayers to the insurance companies which hold their pensions.  A month ago a CD containing the names, national insurance numbers, dates of birth and pension plan numbers of nearly 15,000 Standard Life customers was lost by a courier taking it from the Revenue national insurance contributions office in Newcastle to the insurer's headquarters in Edinburgh.  We have... seen no indications of any suspicious activity  John Gill, Standard Life's director for customer services  A second CD containing data on some customers of an unnamed second firm has also gone missing.  Warning letters have only now been sent to customers by HMRC and Standard Life, five weeks after the data breach occurred.  One customer, Carolyn, was not happy about the delay.  This happened at the end of September and it is a month before notification.  They are saying that addresses were not on there, but if someone has your surname and date of birth it is not that difficult to track you down.  Standard Life's director for customer services, John Gill, told Money Box on Radio 4, We have no evidence that the disc has fallen into third party hands and we have also been closely monitoring all the accounts and have seen no indications of any suspicious activity.  Encryption  The Revenue refused to say on security grounds whether the information was encrypted.  John Gill said it was in a coded format that would not be easy to read.  But the joint letter from the two organisations warned customers that there is a possibility that your personal data could be accessed by someone other than HMRC or Standard Life.  HMRC INFORMATION  For further information, the HMRC has set up the following helplines:(lines open from 0830 to 1700 Monday to Thursday and 0830 to 1630 on Fridays)  Surname beginning A-E: 0845 91 50249 or 0845 91 50134  Surname beginning F-J: 0845 91 50242 or 0845 91 50139  Surname beginning K-O: 0845 91 50267 or 0845 91 50244  Surname beginning P-T: 0845 91 50201 or 0845 91 58845  Surname beginning U-Z: 0845 91 50139  John Gill confirmed that Standard Life was still receiving discs from the Revenue and was awaiting further info from the Revenue on how they propose to do this going forward.  This latest incident is the second time in a month that the Revenue has admitted losing taxpayers' details.  Early in October it revealed that a laptop had been stolen containing data on up to 2000 people with investment ISAs.  BBC Radio 4's Money Box was broadcast on Saturday, 3 November 2007 at 1204 GMT.
Labour 'united despite mistakes'	MySpace in Google software deal	The first official order for the so-called $100 laptop has been placed by the government of Uruguay.  The South American country has bought 100,000 of the machines for schoolchildren aged six to 12.  A further 300,000 may be purchased to provide a machine for every child in the country by 2009.  The order will be a boost for the One Laptop per Child (OLPC) organisation behind the project which has admitted difficulties getting concrete orders.  I have to some degree underestimated the difference between shaking the hand of a head of state and having a cheque written, Nicholas Negroponte, the founder of the organisation, recently told the New York Times.  However, he said he was delighted with the first deal.  We commend Uruguay for being the first country to take concrete actions to provide laptops to all its children and teachers and look forward to other countries following this example, he said.  Rumour factory  The XO laptop, as the machine is known, has been developed to be used primarily by children in the developing world.  It is durable, waterproof and can be powered by solar, foot-pump or pull-string powered chargers. It includes a sunlight readable display so that it can be used outside and has no moving parts.  OLPC aims to sell the laptop for $100 or less. However, over the last year, the machine's price has steadily increased and now costs $188 (93).  Governments were initially offered the green and white machines in lots of 250,000. However, this has since changed and there are now a variety of ways that the laptops are sold or distributed.  For example, from 12 November, members of the public can buy a machine for themselves as well as one for a child in a developing country.  The Give 1 Get 1 (G1G1) programme will initially distribute laptops to Cambodia, Afghanistan, Rwanda and Haiti.  Other schemes allow donors to purchase lots of 100 or more of the machines for a country of their choice. Prices start at $299 (145) per machine.  Connected country  However, the main focus for OLPC has been selling the machines direct to governments.  The $100 has already been tested in many countries  In July, hardware suppliers were told to ramp-up production of all of the components needed to build the low-cost machines.  Many believed that the decision meant that the organisation had met or surpassed the three million orders it need to make production viable. However, the latest news suggests this was not the case.  Previous reports had also suggested deals with the governments of Libya, to provide a laptop for every child, as well as Peru and a sponsorship programme with Italy to provide 50,000 machines to Ethiopia.  A spokesperson for OLPC said none of these were confirmed deals.  Instead, Uruguay is the first country to sign up for the scheme.  The order for 100,000 machines was placed by the state-run Laboratorio Tecnolgico del Uruguay (Latu) which runs a large scale education and communications project known as Ceibal.  The scheme will also provide connectivity to all of the schools involved.  Before placing the order, Latu had also evaluated the rival Intel Classmate PC.  Initially the XO laptops will be distributed in eight to nine of the country's 19 regions. A further 300,000 machines will provide machines for all of the country's children.  We will also cover the rest of the country later in 2008 and Montevideo in 2009, said Miguel Brechner, president of the organisation.
When work becomes a game	Man, 93, dies after car park row	A 93-year-old man has died following a row over parking in a car park on the outskirts of Plymouth.  Police said the elderly man was with his son when they got in to an argument with another man at the Lister Mill Business Park in Plympton, Devon.  The pensioner ended up on the ground with a head injury before being taken to hospital where he later died.  Police said they were unsure whether the man was pushed or fell during the incident at about 1500 GMT on Friday.  'Simple argument'  Jim Webster, Ch Supt of Devon and Cornwall Police, said: The pensioner was doing some business on Friday afternoon, out with his son on a quite ordinary day.  It appears it was a simple argument about a parking space. he added.  There's no indication at this stage that he was punched.  It wasn't a violent argument but it ended up with the aged victim falling to the floor, being taken to hospital with a head injury where he deteriorated.  The 93-year-old from Beacon Park in the city died during the early hours of Saturday morning and officers launched a murder investigation.  A post-mortem examination showed the pensioner died from head injuries.  A 50-year-old man from Plymouth was arrested and taken for questioning at Charles Cross Police Station.

Blanchett defends director role	Intel backs wireless Africa plan	Police have arrested a second man in connection with a fatal stabbing in a block of flats.  Neil Hampson, 32, was attacked on a landing at Havre Tower in the Weston area of Southampton, Hampshire, in the early hours and later died in hospital.  A search for a suspect ended when a 27-year-old man was arrested in Bournemouth, Dorset.  Another man, aged 25 and from Southampton, had already been arrested on suspicion of murder.  Mr Hampson, a single man from the Merryoak area of Southampton, died at the city's general hospital and a murder investigation, codenamed Operation Wycliffe, was launched.  Manhunt  A Hampshire Constabulary spokesperson said a fight broke out on the landing outside a 12th floor flat.  Earlier a manhunt was launched to find a suspect who escaped the scene in a stolen car.  Dorset Police helicopter, dog and firearms officers were drafted in to help with the search.  The stolen car was found shortly before 0800 GMT in Bournemouth.  Mr Hampson's next-of-kin have been informed and a post-mortem examination is expected to be carried out later.  The area outside the flats was cordoned off while crime scene officers investigate.  Det Insp Darren O'Callaghan, from the major crime team, reassured residents it was an isolated incident.
Industry reacts to games review	Bernard Matthews boss quits firm	The Labour government has made some mistakes during the past few weeks, but remains united, Schools Secretary Ed Balls has said.  In a speech to Labour supporters Mr Balls, a close ally of PM Gordon Brown, said the party had the strength to deal with difficult times.  It is still our party that has been setting the policy agenda, he insisted.  The government's parliamentary plans are to be set out on Tuesday.  Echoing comments Mr Brown made in October about ups and downs, Mr Balls said the party had been boosted by a successful conference in September but all was not plain sailing.  I believe that as a party and a government we have shown the strength to deal with difficult times  Ed BallsSchools Secretary  Since then - what can I say - it's been a bit up and down. And we have made some mistakes.  But for all the sound and fury of the past few weeks, it is still our party that has been setting the policy agenda - not taking the easy, short-term course, not just chasing headlines, but showing how a Labour government will meet the long-term challenges our country faces.  And I believe that as a party and a government we have shown the strength to deal with difficult times and keep setting the agenda and responding to the concerns of the British people.  Mr Brown quashed election speculation in early October, saying he wanted a chance to show his vision for Britain.  'Families first'  Mr Balls, speaking on Saturday, said: In the Queen's Speech next week we will set out our programme: to respond to the rising aspirations of the British people; to ensure security for all; to entrust more power to Parliament and the people; and to build a Britain where everybody can rise as far as their talents will take them.  And we will put the concerns of families in every part of our country first.  He criticised the Conservatives for policies which hold people back.  Whether it's on families, health or education, the Tories' vision is a vision of a two-tier Britain.  David Cameron stands for a two-tier Britain, two tiers of opportunity - not just holding young people back from reaching their full potential, but holding the whole country back from what we can achieve together.  Immigration  Labour is not just the Party of the Union, but the true 'one nation' party in British politics. It is our values and our vision which will deliver the change that Britain needs and win the trust of the British people.  The Government was also hit this week by disclosures that it had seriously underestimated the number of foreign workers coming to the UK.  It came as Mr Cameron reopened the debate on immigration, calling for a cap on overall numbers.  But Mr Balls dismissed his speech as just scaremongering and playing to people's fears without any solution to speak of.
Your News	Line up for spectrum gold rush	Carillion is tipped to buy support services firm Alfred McAlpine, after the latter backed a takeover proposal worth nearly 600m.  The 585p cash-and-shares offer is Carillion's third bid since August, its previous two having been rejected.  McAlpine shareholders have been urging the firm to accept a bid since accounting problems emerged at its slate business over the summer.  McAlpine's board is backing the deal, subject to shareholder approval.  Subject to its detailed terms and conditions the board of Alfred McAlpine has confirmed if such an offer were to be made it would receive its unanimous recommendation, Carillion said after the latest offer.  Schroders - McAlpine's largest stakeholder - voiced its backing for a takeover after the bid was made in October.  Carillion's first bid, at 560p a share, was rejected in August as was its second bid the following month.  McAlpine said an internal probe had showed systematic misrepresentation of production volumes and sales at its slate-producing unit.
Ferguson critical of referee Webb	ISAs total value jumps to 208bn	The number of people being declared insolvent in England and Wales fell again in the third quarter of the year.  The number of individual insolvencies dropped by 3% to 26,072 from the previous three months and was 5% down on last year.  Bankruptcies fell by 2.1% to 15,833, while Individual Voluntary Arrangements (IVAs) went down by 4.3% to 10,239  The number of home repossession orders made by courts in England and Wales also fell by 1% in the third quarter.  In the past three months the total dropped to 23,806.  Consumer borrowing  This is the third quarter in a row that the number of people going bust has fallen, and the first time in five years that there has been a year-on-year decrease.  Pat Boyden of accountants PricewaterhouseCoopers said this drop reflected the fact that borrowing on credit cards has been tailing off.  There has been a fall for the last couple of years, so the insolvency figures have levelled off, he said.  Although bankruptcy levels are still 2.2% higher than a year ago, IVAs are now running 14% lower than at the same stage in 2006.  Lee Manning, an insolvency expert at accountancy firm Deloitte, said that was because firms which specialise in setting up IVAs were having to become more circumspect.  There has been considerable pressure on IVA specialists to be more fussy about the cases they take on, he said.  There have been examples of proposed IVAs that were inappropriate and for which the fees were too high.  Repossessions  Despite the fall in the number of repossession orders that lenders have gained in the courts - the first stage in the repossession process - there have been warnings this week that actual repossessions will rise by about 50% next year.  The Council of Mortgage Lenders predicted that repossessions could rise to 45,000 by the end of 2008, with the number of mortgages more than three months in arrears also going up, by 17% to 170,000.  It said this would be due to homeowners finding it impossible to keep up with rising mortgage payments.  Mark Sands, from accountancy firm KPMG, said this in turn would drive up the personal insolvency figures.  They are both driven by the same factors; the ability to refinance and the pressures on household budgets, he said.  We expect long term that they will go up hand-in-hand with repossessions next year.  Have you been affected by the issues covered in this story?

Card companies lose refund case	Man, 93, dies after car park row	Internet Service Providers urgently need to roll out the next generation of net addresses for online devices, internet pioneer Vint Cerf has said.  Every device that goes online is allocated a unique IP address but the pool of numbers is finite and due to run out around 2010.  A new system, called IPv6, has been awaiting roll out for 10 years.  Unless IPv6 is switched on in the coming years, some devices might not be able to go online, Mr Cerf has warned.  Mr Cerf, who played a key role in the development of the protocols which underpin the global net, said: There is a risk of not being able to get online.  He added: The rate of consumption of available remaining IPv4 numbers appears to be on track to run out in 2010/11.  Mr Cerf is about to step down as chairman of Icann, the body which oversees the net, and is also Google's chief internet evangelist.  Potential shortage  The current system, called IPv4 provides four billion addresses but the explosion in the number of devices which go online has led to the potential shortage.  Although IPv6 was standardised 10 years ago it has not been rolled out at speed.  While modern computers, servers, routers and other online devices are able to use IPv6, internet service providers have yet to implement the system.  The reason they haven't - which is quite understandable - is that customers haven't asked for it yet, said Mr Cerf, adding, my job, whether with my Icann hat on or not, is to persuade them to ask for it.  To be clear - if we finally exhaust the IPv4 pool it doesn't mean the internet stops working  Vint Cerf  If you don't ask for it, then when you most want it you won't have it.  IPv6 will create 340 trillion trillion trillion separate addresses, enough to satisfy demand for decades to come.  To be clear - if we finally exhaust the IPv4 pool it doesn't mean the internet stops working. But people wanting an IPv4 address won't get one.  If there is an internet that does not support IPv6, not getting an IPv4 address means not getting on the net.  He added: The appreciation of the importance of getting IPv6 into operation is very much more visible than before.  I'm anticipating in 2008 a substantial increase of use of IPv6, introduced in parallel with IPv4.  One complicating factor is that IPv6 and IPv4 are not compatible so ISPs will have to run the two systems in parallel - adding to costs.  In Asia, governments in China, Korea and Japan have begun to lead roll out of IPv6 and the European Union is reviewing methods to encourage adoption.
National Trust in houses land row	EMI 'artists need to work harder'	Late-night TV chat shows seem likely to be the first victims of a strike by the US screenwriters' union, which has been called over royalty payments.  The Writers Guild of America has asked its 12,000 members to stop working and set up picket lines from Monday.  It wants more cash for work which goes on new media such as DVDs or online.  Shows hosted by stars such as Jay Leno, David Letterman and Jon Stewart are expected to stop almost immediately as they rely on a supply of topical jokes.  They call it the toughest time for comedy writing since those three weeks back in the 1990s when Bill Clinton stopped dating  Talk show host Jay Leno  It was anticipated NBC would broadcast repeats of Leno's programme, The Tonight Show, plus Late Night with Conan O'Brien and Saturday Night Live from Monday if the walkout went ahead, the Hollywood Reporter said.  It also said old episodes of The Daily Show and The Colbert Report would be screened under contingency plans by the Comedy Central channel.  But as yet it was unclear what other networks intended to do, it added.  Leno made a quip about the strike on-air on Friday, saying: They call it the toughest time for comedy writing since those three weeks back in the 1990s when Bill Clinton stopped dating. Remember that?  Filling the gaps  The last such action, in 1988, disrupted the autumn television season.  At that time, Letterman was host of NBC's Late Night, and his programme was taken off-air at first. It did return before the end of the 22-week strike, however, but many other shows remained unbroadcast.  Satirical show The Colbert Report is set to be among the casualties  It is anticipated daytime TV output, such as chat shows and soap operas, would be next to suffer if this month's walkout goes ahead. These series are typically recorded about a week in advance of transmission.  The strike would not immediately impact production of film or primetime TV programmes, the Associated Press reported.  This was because most movie studios had already kept aside a number of scripts, and many high-profile TV dramas and comedies had enough scripts or completed shows to last until early next year.  But then Hollywood analysts do expect the supply of shows such as Desperate Housewives, Ugly Betty and CSI to fizzle out, and many writers fear the TV networks will turn to additional repeats and reality programmes to fill the resulting gaps.  Further negotiations  The studios and the union will meet on Sunday morning for last-ditch talks at a neutral venue.  Writers are demanding an increase in the fees they receive when their work is reproduced on DVDs, and a better share of revenue derived from content on the internet, mobile phones and other electronic devices.  Writers have been taking their protest to the streets of New York  But producers have rejected their demands as unworkable.  This led to Letterman calling producers cowards, cutthroats and weasels on his CBS show on Thursday.  Michael Winship, president of the WGA on the East Coast, said there was still time to prevent the walkout, adding: We urge the studios to come back and bargain fairly.  Nick Counter, president of the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers, said the studios were ready to meet and finish negotiations over the weekend.  Earlier, Mr Counter had said no progress was possible for overriding business reasons as long as writers insisted on increasing royalties from DVD sales.  The DVD issue is a roadblock to these negotiations, he added.  We asked for your views on this story. Here is a selection of the responses received.  I have screenplays registered with the Writer's Guild of America West, so I can have the additional protection when pushing my work overseas, mainly in Japan as a backdoor, so I can get into the USA. I think the MBA (Minimum Usage Agreement) is a poor man's farce, plus what a writer has to do just to achieve entry into the Guild is nearly beyond belief. But on the other side, the amount of cut-throat dishonesty that exists among leading industry producers is much worse. Without the Guild's protection we really would have nothing. Given the global economy in which all mediums compete with everything, a larger royalty belongs to the writers. And let's not forget the overcost of for-profit health care in America that the Guild provides to writers as a benefit. This is always left out of the equation. It's not a benefit, when in reality we are fighting for our lives against a for-profit health care system that's against all of us. I fully support all the writers' efforts as one. But as a free agent, I will continue.Alan Colosi, Boston, Massachusetts  As one of the very few British members of the Writers Guild of America (West), I'm saddened by the Producers' attitude in this negotiation. This is a New Century, and a different world we live in. The Internet has helped change the fabric of our existence, and the WGA Membership are seriously taking new distribution methods for our created material into account now...our livelihoods depend upon it. I believe our Guild have the grim resolve to push this unfortunate strike, until we're finally given a fair piece of the pie we're so instrumental in baking. Be warned, Mr Counter: we're unlikely to cave as readily today as we did nearly two decades ago... Peter Briggs, Los Angeles, California & London, UK  I have been writing these worthless scripts for years. I am actually pleased there will be a strike. Not necessarily for better royalties. I think it will give people a chance to reflect upon the mind-numbing quality of what we are churning out. Andrew Johnston, Evreeware, California  This isn't just about the writers, it affects everyone in this town... from the make-up artists to the production assistants just starting out. People think that it's just rich writers being affected, but they are way off. This town thrives on this industry and the fact that the rich execs wont pay a fair rate to those that deserve it blows my mind. The big issue here is that this is just the start. The contracts with the Directors Guild (DGA) and Screen Actors Guild (SAG) will also be facing this same issue in a few months, so they better figure out something... quick!David Tobin, Hollywood, California  The bright side is that maybe unknown writers like me will be able to get their work noticed out of sheer desperation. Hopefully they will find the talented, unnoticed writers that were unable to get their scripts noticed.Daniel Tokle, Lakewood, Callifornia  Daniel - on behalf of my fellow members of the WGA, I want to remind you that if you submit materials to the signatory studios and production shops during a strike, your action will effectively ban you from joining the WGA, thereby stopping your prospective writing career before it has even begun. JK, New York, New York  I applaud David Letterman's description of the producers as cowards, cutthroats and weasels. But he *was* reading it off the autocue.PedroC, UK  I am a British writer who also works in LA and am a member of the WGA. It may seem to people outside the industry that it's one priviliged group whingeing at another. Apart from the fact that many, if not most, writers struggle to make a living, what's at stake is an erosion of the fundamental right to be paid fairly for the work you do. To put fair share into context: the writer's royalty from a $10 DVD is four cents. The studios have been trying to reduce this!Mark Burton, Reading, UK  Actually, Mark Burton's number is inaccurate - the writer's royalty from a $10 DVD would be TWO cents. It's FOUR cents on a $20 DVD. Which is less than it costs to wrap the thing in plastic.Stephen, Los Angeles, California  It's not like the trash collectors are going on strike, which would have a devastating affect on our lives. It's hard to take someone seriously who produces nothing that society needs.Frank Nelk, Boston, Massachusetts  Writers have always been second-class citizens in Hollywood, viewed as little more than the help. How pathetic is it that Letterman and Leno make millions per year, but if the writers walk out they have to shut it down? Must be nice to earn that much off the work of others...JB, Palmetto, Florida  About time we had a clearout of these mind-numbing shows which are endless unoriginal commercials puntuated by a few minutes of dialogue. Only a few are worth preserving but even they get crass after a few episodes. Hope the strike goes on forever, then we might get a rethink of how to entertain!Bob, Spring, Texas
Kasabian to headline Hogmanay	Line up for spectrum gold rush	
Jail term for Prison Break actor	Net giants test web health	Ten internet users have landed film roles after they auditioned on the social networking site MySpace.  Readers of the website chose the movie's director and several of the actors after producers asked people to participate in the auditions.  The unknowns, who include a student and an aerospace engineer, star alongside actors Paul Nicholls and Tim Healy.  Faintheart, billed as a romantic comedy, is due to be released by the summer of 2008.  'Part of film process'  The movie, which is being backed by Film4 and Vertigo Films, tells the story of Richard, a sales assistant who spends his weekends as a Mighty Norse Warrior in battle re-enactments.  Director Vito Rocco won his role after 500,000 MySpace users, who viewed the short film he submitted online, chose him.  We've given cinema-goers and online users the first real opportunity to be part of the film-making process right the way through from script to seeing the results of their input up on the big screen, he said.  MySpace users will also contribute to the script.
December shoot for X Files sequel	Man in court over schoolgirl gun	The number of new jobs created in the US leapt dramatically in October with employers adding 166,000 posts, twice the expected number.  The surprise growth in jobs suggests the US economy remains robust in the face of a housing slump, credit crunch and high oil prices, analysts said.  Separate data showed orders placed at US factories edged up 0.2% in September - having dropped 3.5% in August.  This was much better than the predicted 0.4% month-on-month decline.  Still hiring  Job gains were prominent in the professional services sector as well as in education and health care, the Labor department said with increases in these areas offsetting losses in manufacturing and construction.  But with unemployment steady at 4.7% in October, it appears that the overall economy may be holding up well, observers said.  The wheels aren't coming off the economy  Ken Mayland, Clear View Economics  The employment situation in the US is seen as crucial to how well it weathers its financial difficulties.  Businesses have not clammed up on the hiring scene as some feared, said Ken Mayland, of Clear View Economics.  The wheels aren't coming off the economy.  Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein economist Kevin Logan said that not too much attention should be paid to the growth in factory orders.  These numbers are really just background noise, he argued.  Everybody is focused on financial market problems and that is what is dominating the financial markets themselves.  The stock market is worried about potentially bad news emanating from the financial sector and the bond market reflects that as well.
Card companies lose refund case	PS3 network enters record books	Councillors in Cornwall have begun to prepare for turning the county's local councils into a unitary authority.  Some of the districts had waged a campaign against the single status plan, claiming it would not benefit the taxpayers.  But Cornwall County Council said becoming a unitary authority would eventually save taxpayers 17m a year.  Councillor Graham Facks-Martin said the meeting of the 24 representatives had been constructive.  The councillors represented the county council and six district councils.  Jobs concern  The district councils have waged a campaign against the creation of the controversial single authority - some making claims of it being too centralised and undemocratic.  A unitary authority will be responsible for roads and education, as well as leisure, environmental health and housing.  If unitary status is approved there will be a reduction in the number of councillors.  The public service union Unison has raised concerns about the effect the change could have on jobs.  Subject to legislation the new authority could be up and running in 2009.
House price falls 'don't matter'	Protest as memorial unveiled	Hundreds of thousands of people are fleeing severe flooding in the southern Mexican state of Tabasco.  The state capital, Villahermosa, has been largely abandoned after the Grijalva river burst its banks late Thursday, submerging much of the city.  President Felipe Calderon has ordered the entire air force to help bring supplies in and move people out.  Some 80% of the state is under water and 800,000 people are homeless in the state's worst flooding in 50 years.  Roads clogged  Villahermosa, and many other towns in the state, have been turned into brown lakes with only treetops and roofs visible.  Heavy rain is forecast for the weekend and there are concerns that disease could spread in the murky waters.  Emergency officials say that supplies of fresh water, food, fuel and medicine are running extremely low.  In pictures: Mexico floods  At least one death has been reported.  Roads out of Villahermosa that are not flooded have been clogged with cars, buses and trucks full of people trying to leave the region.  Get us out of here, pleaded Josefina Vilchis as Villahermosa residents boarded buses to leave the city.  We've lost everything, and the lives of our grandchildren is all we are interested in. Please, there is no transport here - there is nothing, she told Reuters news agency.  President Calderon has pledged the full support of his government to help more than a million people hit by the floods.  He has given special powers to soldiers and police to maintain order and prevent looting and called on private airlines to help with the relief efforts as most roads in and out of the state have been cut off by the floodwaters.  After flying over the state, Mr Calderon described the flooding as not just the worst natural catastrophe in the state's history but, I would venture to say, one of the worst in the country's recent history.  Once the critical stage was over, he said, we are going to reconstruct Tabasco whatever it takes.  'Fighting a monster'  On Friday, rescue workers used helicopters and boats to try to rescue thousands of people trapped on rooftops by the rising waters.  Hospital patients were flown to neighbouring states.  Interior Minister Francisco Ramirez said the extent of the disaster in the flood-prone state had taken the government by surprise.  Tabasco state governor, Andres Granier, said: We are fighting against a monster and urged anyone who owned a boat to help out.  He said 100% of the state's crops were lost.  Mr Granier drew a comparison to the damage caused by Hurricane Katrina on the US Gulf Coast two years ago, saying New Orleans was small compared to this.  Oil exports halted  The floods were triggered by storms that crippled Mexico's oil industry.  People are frantic, families are split up everyone is searching for someone.  Mark Pius CharltonVillahermosa  Your flood accounts  Twenty-one people died last week when storms forced an oil platform into another rig in the Gulf of Mexico.  Flooding has also affected the southern state of Chiapas, where several thousand people have been moved to safety.  The storms have forced the closure of three of Mexico's main oil ports, preventing almost all exports and halting a fifth of the country's oil production.  Are you in the area?

Search for missing firefighters	Machinima to go mainstream	His work sells for thousands of pounds and he is feted by the Hollywood elite, yet the identity of guerrilla artist Banksy remains shrouded in mystery.  Now a photograph has emerged which some people claim could show the reclusive artist at work on a London street.  The photograph, taken by a passer-by in Bethnal Green, shows a man at work with an assistant, scaffolding and a truck.  Banksy made his name with stencils and subversive art in public spaces but fiercely guards his true identity.  The photographer, who wishes to remain anonymous, is familiar with Banksy's work and took the shot as she was passing the artist at work.  The mural depicts double yellow lines veering off a road and up the side of a building, creating an outline of a flower. A stencil of a painter sits beside it.  But like some of his stencils that appear periodically around his home city, authenticating the image as Banksy could prove difficult.  The completed mural shows a painter and a flower  While his anonymity has captured public imagination in the artist and his work, it leaves him open to copycats.  A recent auction of 10 pieces of original Banksy art sold for more than 500,000 in Bonhams, London.  He has also become a favourite with Hollywood stars, with Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie buying his work at a recent exhibition in Los Angeles.  A possible new piece of his work appeared in his home city of Bristol earlier in the month opposite the Children's Hospital.  It shows an armed police officer with a child about to burst a paper bag behind him. Hospital workers said they liked the piece.  But in Tower Hamlets a decision has been made to treat all of Banksy's stencilled artwork as graffiti to be painted over.  A spokesman for Tower Hamlets Council said: In this case, Banksy has sought permission from the owners of the privately-owned building for his latest work.  We do however need to look at the issue of the yellow lines as we have a legal obligation to reinstate the bit of the double yellow lines which has been painted out.  As ever, priority is given to the removal of offensive graffiti.
Dallaglio fears Test career over	Google opens up social networks	The number of people being declared insolvent in England and Wales fell again in the third quarter of the year.  The number of individual insolvencies dropped by 3% to 26,072 from the previous three months and was 5% down on last year.  Bankruptcies fell by 2.1% to 15,833, while Individual Voluntary Arrangements (IVAs) went down by 4.3% to 10,239  The number of home repossession orders made by courts in England and Wales also fell by 1% in the third quarter.  In the past three months the total dropped to 23,806.  Consumer borrowing  This is the third quarter in a row that the number of people going bust has fallen, and the first time in five years that there has been a year-on-year decrease.  Pat Boyden of accountants PricewaterhouseCoopers said this drop reflected the fact that borrowing on credit cards has been tailing off.  There has been a fall for the last couple of years, so the insolvency figures have levelled off, he said.  Although bankruptcy levels are still 2.2% higher than a year ago, IVAs are now running 14% lower than at the same stage in 2006.  Lee Manning, an insolvency expert at accountancy firm Deloitte, said that was because firms which specialise in setting up IVAs were having to become more circumspect.  There has been considerable pressure on IVA specialists to be more fussy about the cases they take on, he said.  There have been examples of proposed IVAs that were inappropriate and for which the fees were too high.  Repossessions  Despite the fall in the number of repossession orders that lenders have gained in the courts - the first stage in the repossession process - there have been warnings this week that actual repossessions will rise by about 50% next year.  The Council of Mortgage Lenders predicted that repossessions could rise to 45,000 by the end of 2008, with the number of mortgages more than three months in arrears also going up, by 17% to 170,000.  It said this would be due to homeowners finding it impossible to keep up with rising mortgage payments.  Mark Sands, from accountancy firm KPMG, said this in turn would drive up the personal insolvency figures.  They are both driven by the same factors; the ability to refinance and the pressures on household budgets, he said.  We expect long term that they will go up hand-in-hand with repossessions next year.  Have you been affected by the issues covered in this story?

Motorway crash victim dies	Iraq vows to arrest PKK rebels	Police are continuing to question a man and a woman arrested after a police officer was hit by a car as she tried to arrest the driver.  Det Con Catherine Corbett, 39, of Solihull, remains in a critical condition after the incident in Hayes, west London, on Friday morning.  A man, 41, was arrested in Birmingham on suspicion of the attempted murder of the West Midlands Police officer.  A 32-year-old woman is also being held in London in connection with the case.  Det Con Corbett was trying to arrest a man outside the Sheraton Skyline Hotel, near Heathrow Airport, when he drove off and knocked her over at 0800 GMT.  Police said the officer was hit by the open passenger door as the suspect reversed away from the scene in a blue Peugeot 207.  Fraud inquiry  She suffered serious head injuries and underwent surgery at Charing Cross Hospital's neurological unit on Friday night.  A spokeswoman for West Midlands Police said: She is now out of surgery and everything went well, but her condition is still critical.  Our thoughts and prayers are with Cathy and her family and we are anxiously waiting news from the hospital.  The suspect also crashed into a Ford Focus  A man arrested in Bordesley Green, Birmingham, on Friday, was transferred to a London police station overnight.  A woman was also arrested in connection with the inquiry after she attended a London police station.  Police said as the suspect left the car park the vehicle collided with a black Ford Focus, damaging its front bumper and bonnet.  Two other male officers also suffered minor injuries as they were carried for a short distance on the bonnet of the Peugeot.  The car was later found abandoned in Harlington Road.  Det Con Corbett had been in London for the previous two days as part of a fraud investigation.  Detectives said they had been hunting the suspect for about 12 months.
Second arrest over fatal stabbing	Strike set to silence talk shows	A man died and another was left with serious injuries in a motorway collision in Kent.  Police said the accident happened on the coastbound M20 early on Saturday between junction eight for Maidstone and junction nine for Ashford.  The road crash involved one car at about 0345 GMT, a spokesman said.  Traffic was diverted and part of the motorway was closed while officers examined the road, he added. The motorway has since reopened.
Share and share alike	Chevron sees profits tumble 25%	Northern Rock and the Bank of England expect that by the end of the year the Rock will have borrowed 30bn from the central bank, the BBC has learned.  It follows Thursday's news that Northern Rock has already borrowed almost 23bn in emergency funding.  That is roughly 730 for every UK taxpayer and marks a rise of 2.2bn from the week ended 31 October.  Northern Rock has been in trouble since the global credit crunch hurt its business and led to a run on the bank.  To win back investor confidence, the government has guaranteed all Northern Rock deposits and loans.  Bigger problem  We are talking about total public-sector exposure to the Rock of 40bn  Robert Peston, BBC business editor  Rock's loan could surge  The BBC's business editor Robert Peston says this means that the UK taxpayer's exposure to Northern Rock could be much more than currently thought.  The extent of public sector support goes beyond these direct loans, he said.  The Treasury has also indemnified a further 20bn odd of retail deposits, he explained.  So we are talking about total public-sector exposure to the Rock of 40bn - equivalent to around 3% of our entire economy.  And that exposure could become much bigger, as other loans to the Rock fall due for repayment.   Later on Thursday, Mr Peston learned that Northern Rock and the Bank of England were projecting that the firm would have borrowed a staggering 30bn from the Bank of England by year end, he said.  Problem model  The problem facing Northern Rock is that three-quarters of its funding came from wholesale money markets, and when the global credit crunch took hold, its main source of financing dried up.  Simply put, banks were so worried about the problems in the global debt market that they stopped lending to each other, making it almost impossible for Northern Rock to keep operating.  As a result, the lender turned to the Bank of England for emergency funding, prompting the run and its current set of problems.  I don't think the loans will stop growing until a decision has been made about the bank's future  Simon Ward, economist, New Star Asset Management  News of the borrowing from the Bank comes as financial firms Virgin Group and JC Flowers have been looking to acquire Northern Rock.  However, none of the possible bidders is likely to buy the firm without a guarantee that the government-backed loans will stay in place.  Simon Ward, economist at New Star Asset Management, said: I don't think the loans will stop growing until a decision has been made about the bank's future.  Resignation  In the weeks since the bank was first given emergency funding, the firm's chairman Matt Ridley has resigned.  Both he and chief executive Adam Applegarth were criticised by MPs in October about the bank's business model.  But they defended its strategy of borrowing large amounts of money in financial markets that they then lent to house buyers as mortgages.  Northern Rock has declined to comment on the latest Bank of England numbers but has said that former estimates of its loans, using the bank's data, were correct.
Clooney's waxwork is retouched	Carillion set to acquire McAlpine	A pizza shop supervisor who was sacked and replaced by cheaper migrant workers has won a claim for unfair dismissal against his former boss.  Kevin Lewis, 26, from Tranmere in Wirral, worked at Domino's on London Road in Liverpool.  Mr Lewis was sacked when he refused a transfer to a branch in Chester because he could not afford the travel costs.  He was replaced by Polish immigrants who were paid the minimum wage and had accommodation deducted by their boss.  Compensation awaited  An employment tribunal in Liverpool heard three Poles and one Iranian were hired to work at the shop in the city, in September 2006 and paid 5.35 an hour.  Mr Lewis, who was paid 6 an hour, was offered a transfer to another branch, but refused and was later sacked.  Mr Lewis, who is now a youth worker, will hear how much compensation he is to receive next month.  He said his is a victory for British workers.  This is just one case - there could be thousands, he said. I was just treated like I was dispensable.  AKS Partners Ltd, which runs the store, was unavailable for comment.
Ferguson critical of referee Webb	Search for missing firefighters	Teachers and parents protesting against plans to build a city academy on a sports ground have taken up residence opposite Brent town hall.  Demonstrators have created a Tent City outside the council offices in Forty Lane, Wembley, north London.  They want a vote on whether the proposed academy should be built on Wembley Park Sports Ground.  Brent Council previously said it would not reverse its decision to allow Wembley Park City Academy to be built.  The facility is due to be completed by 2010.  Direct action  Protesters object to the sale of the land for the development of a privately-run city academy.  They want it to be built on an alternative site in the south of the borough and for the sports ground to remain intact.  The protesters camped on the proposed site for six months from March this year and moved into tree houses after they said they were threatened with eviction.  Protester Hank Roberts said: Our message is clear - give us a democratic vote on whether the proposed academy should be built on the Wembley Park site leading to the loss of the sports fields or not.  If they don't give us this they can expect the campaign of direct action to continue and escalate.

Ramones manager is found dead	ISAs total value jumps to 208bn	Two men have been arrested as part of the Financial Services Authority's (FSA) first criminal investigation into illegal share selling.  The two suspects were arrested on Wednesday after police helped the FSA raid several addresses in England.  The FSA suspects the men of involvement with Universal Management Services (UMS), a front for fraudulent share traders known as boiler rooms.  The regulator suspects victims of the fraud may have been conned out of 5m.  Victims  Boiler rooms are usually based overseas but sometimes operate with the help of front organisations in the UK that channel the money abroad.  The FSA has no jurisdiction overseas but tries to close down any boiler room activities here.  The fraudsters involved are not authorised by the FSA and typically sell shares to unsuspecting members of the public by cold-calling them.  It shows we will not hesitate to use our powers to protect consumers, including launching criminal investigations where appropriate  Jonathan Phelan, FSA  Q&A: What are boiler rooms?  They then persuade their victims to buy shares that are worthless or have little value.  The FSA said it suspected that UMS had been helping illegal boiler rooms after it received complaints from the public about the high-pressure tactics of the salesmen, who had told their victims to make out cheques to UMS.  The FSA said UMS, which is unrelated to at least four UK registered companies with similar names, appeared to have been taking payments for at least six known boiler rooms.  Assets worth about 5.5m have been frozen so far as part of the investigation.  This the first time we have taken this action and it shows that we will not hesitate to use our powers to protect consumers, including launching criminal investigations where appropriate, said Jonathan Phelan, head of retail enforcement at the FSA.
Machinima to go mainstream	Driving the boundaries of realism	TV hosts Richard Madeley and Judy Finnegan are to quit their Channel 4 daytime chatshow, they have announced.  The husband-and-wife team will give up their afternoon show when their contract ends next year to focus on other TV projects.  The move marks the end of 20 years of presenting live daily shows together.  The programme is still full of life, but we have taken the difficult decision to leave it on a high, Madeley said.  After seven consecutive years we both feel we have achieved everything we wanted with the show.  We want the chance to launch other projects in broadcasting and writing while we are still young enough, he added.  Book specials  The duo will present another two series of their teatime show on Channel 4 next year and will front a Richard & Judy's Christmas Books special for the broadcaster this December.  CAREER HIGHS AND LOWS  Richard and Judy launch their Book Club strand in 2004. It goes on to boost the fortunes of featured authors  Morning TV's first testicle appears on This Morning in 1999 to raise awareness of testicular cancer  Judy inadvertently reveals her bra at the 2000 National TV awards  In 2005 Cherie Blair bemoans the fact her husband Tony has never bought her flowers  Richard becomes famous (or infamous) for his Ali G impression in 2000  Richard faces criticism in 2004 after using the term dyke on his Channel 4 show when trying to refer to lesbians in a hip way  This year, the company behind competition You Say, We Pay was fined 150,000 after viewers were urged to call a premium number after contestants had already been chosen  Richard and Judy are also in talks with Channel 4 to present a spin-off Book Club series, as well as other specials including A Summer Read and The British Book Awards.  Julian Bellamy, head of programmes at Channel 4, said: Richard and Judy have informed us that they do not wish to continue their show after their current contract comes to an end in 2008.  Channel 4 wishes to thank them for the fantastic contribution they have made to the channel over the last seven years.  We wish them great success and will continue to look at opportunities to work with them in the future, he added.  Comedy shows  Richard and Judy found fame hosting ITV's This Morning in 1988 before defecting to Channel 4 in 2001.  Their teatime show was also hit by the premium rate phone-in scandal over its You Say We Pay quiz earlier this year.  Richard and Judy's announcement coincides with Channel 4 announcing a new string of shows.  Thanks to a 3m boost to its comedy budget, new shows Plus One - from the writers of Life on Mars - and The Kevin Bishop Show will hit screens in the new year.  The IT Crowd, sketch show Modern Toss and Peep Show will also return.
Pizza worker was unfairly sacked	Support for ad-tracking opt out	Shares in Barclays Bank have fallen to two-and-a-half-year lows amid continuing speculation about funding problems linked to the credit crunch.  The shares fell by 8% to 524.5p at one point but later recovered, closing down 5.9%, or 34 pence, at 537.5p.  Rumours about Barclays first emerged in August when technical problems twice forced the bank to borrow overnight funds from the Bank of England.  Barclays declined to comment but has always denied having funding problems.  In a move designed to allay market fears the bank's head of global retail and commercial banking, Frits Seegers, bought Barclays shares worth almost 700,000 ($1.5m) on Friday.  There are concerns about writedowns and everything else, but the comments Barclays have made to date suggest that is not an issue, as does the fact they are still buying back their own shares, said Ian Poulter at Landsbanki Financials.
Machinima to go mainstream	MySpace in Google software deal	A second man has been arrested under the Terrorism Act after potentially explosive materials were seized at a house in Goole in East Yorkshire.  The 31-year-old from Goole, was arrested in the Dundee area of Tayside at 0130 GMT on Saturday.  Another 31-year-old was arrested in Goole on Wednesday following a search of a house in Pasture Road.  The man arrested in Dundee will be brought to Leeds for questioning by Counter Terrorism Unit (CTU) officers.  On Friday, a court approved a warrant to hold the man detained on Wednesday for seven days.  He was being held pending further inquiries by CTU officers and the results of forensic tests, police said.
Russia in Ukraine refinery spat	Dollar at fresh low against euro	Linda Stein, former co-manager of punk band The Ramones, has been found dead at her Manhattan apartment.  A pathologist said the 62-year-old, who went on to become one of New York's leading estate agents, died from blows to the head and neck.  Stein, the ex-wife of Sire Records head Seymour Stein, managed the Ramones with Danny Fields during their 1970s heyday.  After parting company with the band in 1980, she went into property. Her clients included Sting and Billy Joel.  Long-time friend Sir Elton John told the New York Times he was absolutely shocked and upset.  'Roller coaster'  According to the newspaper, Stein was the model for the agent who tries to sell Charlie Sheen's character an apartment in the film Wall Street.  Born in Manhattan, she worked as a teacher before a blind date with Seymour Stein brought her into the music business.  The record mogul would later tell Vanity Fair magazine their marriage had resembled eight years on a roller coaster, and not always strapped in.  Stein is credited with arranging The Ramones' July 1976 appearance at the Roundhouse in London, thought to be one of the key moments in the creation of the British punk scene.
Search for missing firefighters	Fresh fall in insolvency numbers	Hollywood screenwriters and producers have failed to resolve a contract dispute at last-ditch talks.  The failure means the writers may stage a strike that could cripple production of many television programmes.  Studios have stockpiled scripts, but they will have no writers for comedy programmes that depend on topical gags.  The writers' union is seeking extra payments for their work when it is re-used on other platforms such as DVDs, the internet and mobile phones.  At present, they receive nothing extra if their work is featured in such formats.  The writers' current contract with the studios expired at 0001 local time (0701 GMT) with no replacement agreed and no new negotiations immediately scheduled.  Fruitless talks  Wednesday's negotiations started with the Writers' Guild of America (WGA) reportedly presenting a new set of proposals containing unspecified concessions and were attended by a federal mediator.  Late-night comedy shows may be among the first affected  But after eight hours of talks the studios issued a statement saying the writers' demand for a greater share of revenue from DVD sales constituted a complete roadblock to any further progress.  The WGA should take the necessary steps now to break this impasse, said the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers.  But in its statement, the union disputed this version of events, saying the alliance had insisted writers not only accept the existing hated DVD formula, but extend it to internet downloads.  Every issue that matters to writers, including Internet reuse, original writing for new media, DVDs, and jurisdiction, has been ignored in the bargaining, said the WGA. This is completely unacceptable.  The WGA voted unanimously in favour of strike action two weeks ago, but it is unclear whether it will go ahead.  In the event of a strike, the studios are expected to resort to repeats, extended news programmes and reality TV shows.  However, late-night topical comedy shows - such as the Tonight Show with Jay Leno and the Daily Show with Jon Stewart - would be severely affected.  The last major WGA strike in 1988 lasted 22 weeks, delayed the start of the autumn TV season and cost the industry an estimated $500m.  The studios say higher royalties for writers on new media products would stifle growth at a time of increasing production costs, but the union accuses the studios of pleading poverty while earning healthy profits.
Man held in counter-terror raid	Tamil rebels vow to strike back	The first official order for the so-called $100 laptop has been placed by the government of Uruguay.  The South American country has bought 100,000 of the machines for schoolchildren aged six to 12.  A further 300,000 may be purchased to provide a machine for every child in the country by 2009.  The order will be a boost for the One Laptop per Child (OLPC) organisation behind the project which has admitted difficulties getting concrete orders.  I have to some degree underestimated the difference between shaking the hand of a head of state and having a cheque written, Nicholas Negroponte, the founder of the organisation, recently told the New York Times.  However, he said he was delighted with the first deal.  We commend Uruguay for being the first country to take concrete actions to provide laptops to all its children and teachers and look forward to other countries following this example, he said.  Rumour factory  The XO laptop, as the machine is known, has been developed to be used primarily by children in the developing world.  It is durable, waterproof and can be powered by solar, foot-pump or pull-string powered chargers. It includes a sunlight readable display so that it can be used outside and has no moving parts.  OLPC aims to sell the laptop for $100 or less. However, over the last year, the machine's price has steadily increased and now costs $188 (93).  Governments were initially offered the green and white machines in lots of 250,000. However, this has since changed and there are now a variety of ways that the laptops are sold or distributed.  For example, from 12 November, members of the public can buy a machine for themselves as well as one for a child in a developing country.  The Give 1 Get 1 (G1G1) programme will initially distribute laptops to Cambodia, Afghanistan, Rwanda and Haiti.  Other schemes allow donors to purchase lots of 100 or more of the machines for a country of their choice. Prices start at $299 (145) per machine.  Connected country  However, the main focus for OLPC has been selling the machines direct to governments.  The $100 has already been tested in many countries  In July, hardware suppliers were told to ramp-up production of all of the components needed to build the low-cost machines.  Many believed that the decision meant that the organisation had met or surpassed the three million orders it need to make production viable. However, the latest news suggests this was not the case.  Previous reports had also suggested deals with the governments of Libya, to provide a laptop for every child, as well as Peru and a sponsorship programme with Italy to provide 50,000 machines to Ethiopia.  A spokesperson for OLPC said none of these were confirmed deals.  Instead, Uruguay is the first country to sign up for the scheme.  The order for 100,000 machines was placed by the state-run Laboratorio Tecnolgico del Uruguay (Latu) which runs a large scale education and communications project known as Ceibal.  The scheme will also provide connectivity to all of the schools involved.  Before placing the order, Latu had also evaluated the rival Intel Classmate PC.  Initially the XO laptops will be distributed in eight to nine of the country's 19 regions. A further 300,000 machines will provide machines for all of the country's children.  We will also cover the rest of the country later in 2008 and Montevideo in 2009, said Miguel Brechner, president of the organisation.
Record payout for sacked worker	X Factor Emily pulls out of show	The first global map of magnetic peculiarities - or anomalies - on Earth has been assembled by an international team of researchers.  Magnetic anomalies are caused by differences in the magnetisation of the rocks in the Earth's crust.  Many years of negotiation were required to obtain confidential data from governments and institutes.  Scientists hope to use the map to learn more about the geological composition of our planet.  One should not underestimate the diplomatic efforts needed to secure support and data contributions from these organisations  Dr Michael Purucker, Nasa  The World Digital Magnetic Anomaly Map (WDMAM) is available through the Commission for the Geological Map of the World.  The magnetic signature of the Earth's crust has been measured for many decades by a multitude of groups; but now, for the first time, the data has been combined to give a truly worldwide view of the phenomenon.  A British company involved in the project is GETECH, a spin-off from Leeds University.  Valuable tool  Managing Director Dr J Derek Fairhead explains: The project is the result of a lot of coordinating efforts by the IAGA (International Association of Geomagnetism and Aeronomy) organisation to put together a magnetic map of the world, and it's taken decades to get to this position.  The Kursk Magnetic Anomaly has been exploited for iron ores  Enlarge Image
Fresh protests in Georgia capital	Employment boosts US economy	X Factor finalist Emily Nakanda has withdrawn from the show after a video emerged showing her allegedly attacking a teenage girl.  The 15-year-old was seen punching and grabbing the girl by the hair in the video recorded on a mobile phone.  A spokeswoman for the show said as a result of their investigations Emily had chosen to pull out of the contest with immediate effect.  Emily's mentor Sharon Osbourne said she was deeply saddened by the situation.  'Very sorry'  Louis Friberg, Emily's mother, said: As a family we are heartbroken and are very disappointed with Emily's behaviour, we feel that there is no choice but to withdraw Emily from the competition.  Emily regrets her actions but there is no way, as a family, we can excuse her behaviour. Emily is very sorry to have let the show, Sharon and the viewers down.  In the statement Ms Friberg also said her daughter and all the family sincerely apologise to the girl involved, her school and all the fans that have supported Emily.  FAMOUS TALENT SHOW EXITS  Oct 2007:Cece Jghalef was disqualified from X Factor finalist group Hope after a criminal conviction was discovered  June 2007: Richard Bates was withdrawn from Britain's Got Talent after discovery he was on the sex offenders' register  Oct 2002: Peter Smith quit Pop Stars: The Rivals after admitting he was too old to compete - by two months  2001/2: Nadine Coyle was disqualified from the Irish version of Popstars for being two years underage - she later won a place in Girls Aloud  Another video emerged earlier this week on YouTube showing Emily and a group of friends laughing and threatening a teenager, while one of the group held what appeared to be a weapon.  It is believed the videos were filmed before Emily entered The X Factor and have since been removed from the website.  As the youngest finalist to ever have competed on the programme, Simon Cowell said Emily was the reason the age range was lowered.  She won over the judges with her innocent looks and Osbourne said in one episode that she had a butter wouldn't melt personality.  Bookie refunds  The singer also gained the sympathy of viewers by revealing that she almost died from the stomach infection peritonitis last year.  She was due to sing Bjork's It's Oh So Quiet on the next programme.  Show organisers have said that Emily's withdrawal will not affect the voting on the show this Saturday and one act will still leave the competition.  Bookmaker Ladbrokes said it would refund all bets on the teenager following her shock exit.  We think the only fair thing to do, given the circumstances, is to void all bets on Emily regardless of the market, a Ladbrokes spokesman said.

Astronaut fixes torn solar panel	Google opens up social networks	Author Harper Lee is to be given America's highest civilian honour by President George W Bush for her outstanding contribution to literature.  Her only novel, To Kill a Mockingbird, which was a plea for racial tolerance, won the Pulitzer Prize in 1961.  The award will be presented to Lee during a ceremony at the White House on 5 November.  The Presidential Medal of Freedom was reinstated in 1963 by President Kennedy to honour remarkable achievements.  Falsely accused  Past recipients of the honour include Muhammad Ali, Aretha Franklin and Doris Day.  Lee, 81, who stopped giving interviews after winning the Pulitzer Prize, rarely makes public appearances.  The film version of To Kill A Mockingbird, made in 1962, won an Oscar for actor Gregory Peck.  He played laywer Atticus Finch, a lawyer who represented a black man who was falsely accused of rape.  In a rare article published in The Oprah Magazine last year, Lee said that in a society where technology prevails, I still plod along with books.
Search for missing firefighters	Barclays shares hit 30-month low	Credit card firms have been told by the House of Lords they must refund people who buy goods and services abroad that are undelivered or damaged.  Five Law Lords have dismissed an appeal by Lloyds TSB and Tesco Personal Finance, who had challenged the application of the Consumer Credit Act.  Section 75 says credit card purchases between 100 and 30,000 are insured by the card issuing companies.  The Lords' decision upholds an earlier decision of the Appeal Court.  It confirms that credit card issuers are individually and jointly liable with suppliers if a consumer has a valid claim against the supplier for misrepresentation or breach of contract, said John Fingleton, chief executive of the Office of Fair Trading (OFT).  The application of section 75 to overseas credit card purchases has long been uncertain, which is unsatisfactory for UK consumers.  We are pleased that the House of Lords has resolved the issue, and particularly happy that it has been resolved in a way that gives greater protection to consumers, he added.  Decision  The Law Lords said the 1974 Act gave no indication that there was any territorial limitation on the banks' obligations.  They have come to the conclusion that the card issuer is in a much better position to pursue the foreign supplier  Hugh Evans, DLA Piper  There is nothing in the language of section 75(1) to exclude foreign transactions, said Lord Hoffmann.  Lord Hope of Craighead backed this up.  The answer to the question whether the right of recourse under section 75(1) does extend to foreign transactions is to be found in the words of the statute, not in any presumption either way as to its application extraterritorially, he said.  As one looks for the answer, the most striking feature is the absence of any indication in the subsection that it was the intention that it should not apply to them [foreign transactions], he added.  Hugh Evans, of the legal firm DLA Piper, said the Law Lords had also looked at the underlying commercial situation.  The Law Lords say it is all about the allocation of risk - who should pick up the bill if the transaction goes wrong?  They have come to the conclusion that the card issuer is in a much better position to pursue the foreign supplier, said Mr Evans.  Bank disappointment  The banks responded to the Law Lords' decision with disappointment, but not surprise.  Foreign travel and the internet have opened up huge new markets to consumers  Martyn Hocking, Which? Money  At long last we have clarity, said Sandra Quinn of the card services organisation Apacs.  The banks now know where they stand and there is no doubt it is good for consumers.  She pointed out, though, that the banks were not concerned so much with small-ticket items that failed to be delivered.  She argued that the main problem for banks was any consequential loss - for instance, being liable for all costs in the US that might arise out of a crash in a car hired with a credit card payment.  Legal costs there are not cheap, she said.  Martyn Hocking, the editor of Which? Money said the legal decision was excellent news.  Foreign travel and the internet have opened up huge new markets to consumers.  With most credit card companies, consumers already pay a charge each time they use a credit card abroad - the least they can expect is the same level of protection as they enjoy at home, Mr Hocking added.
National Trust in houses land row	Traders 'fear' market expansion	The mother of a Belfast teenager who committed suicide has said drugs and the dealers who sell them must be taken off the streets.  Alison Clarke's 16-year-old son, Dean, hanged himself days after taking a large number of horse tranquilisers.  He died in hospital a week after being found on the Limestone Road in the north of the city.  When I went to the scene I wasn't allowed near him. I wasn't even allowed in the ambulance, she said.  He had no heartbeat, he had no pulse. the ambulance crew did everything to get his heartbeat back.  When he got to the hospital he had no oxygen going to his brain, my son was brain dead.

Italian police seek murder clues	Lower margins hit Exxon profits	Thousands of health workers have marched through central London as part of a campaign against NHS reforms.  Organisers said about 7,000 staff took part in the I Love The NHS event which finished in Trafalgar Square.  TUC president David Prentice told the rally that the service must not be sold off to private companies.  Bridlington GP Hamish Meldrum, chairman of the BMA's council, said: As GPs, we're saying stop blaming us for the NHS's problems.  Stop going on about us as overpaid and not working hard enough. It's actually the GPs who have the potential to help save the NHS.  We are here today to tell the world that we will not allow our health service to be sold off to private companies on the altar of profit  TUC president David Prentis  In pictures: NHS march  London mayor Ken Livingstone sent a message to the demonstrators by video.  He said the NHS was the single most important social advance of my lifetime.  TUC president David Prentis told the rally: We are here today to tell the world that we will not allow our health service to be sold off to private companies on the altar of profit.  Health Minister Ann Keen commented that staff had endured a tough year but that the NHS had to keep pace with rising public expectations.  'Focus unremittingly'  The NHS budget will increase to 110bn in 2010-11, more than triple the 1997 total, she said.  This extra investment, combined with increased efficiency, means we can focus unremittingly on improving quality, safety and access for all within a locally accountable and clinically led NHS.  Earlier, Karen Jennings of the Unison union said a health service that is free at the point of need and paid for by taxation should be cherished.  Mrs Jennings told BBC News: We're coming up to its 60th anniversary, and we're very keen to get the message across that we've got quite an extraordinary health service in this country.  One that is free at the point of use, one that is equal to all that need to use it, is paid for by direct taxation, and is probably one of the most efficient health services in the world.  She said despite criticisms by politicians and the press, surveys have shown that the vast majority of people who use the NHS are very satisfied with it.  'Very worried'  She said: Many, many comparable countries, their citizens really fear having to pay for their healthcare and whether they can afford it and we don't have these worries here.  We've got something that is a very precious resource here and we shouldn't undermine the ethos that exists, and the founding principles on which the NHS is based.  Mrs Jennings said she was very worried about plans by the Conservatives to introduce more competition into the health service.  She said: The big fear that staff working on the NHS have, and many, many local communities, is that you fragment the NHS if you make it too competitive.
Industry reacts to games review	Second arrest over fatal stabbing	The number of people being declared insolvent in England and Wales fell again in the third quarter of the year.  The number of individual insolvencies dropped by 3% to 26,072 from the previous three months and was 5% down on last year.  Bankruptcies fell by 2.1% to 15,833, while Individual Voluntary Arrangements (IVAs) went down by 4.3% to 10,239  The number of home repossession orders made by courts in England and Wales also fell by 1% in the third quarter.  In the past three months the total dropped to 23,806.  Consumer borrowing  This is the third quarter in a row that the number of people going bust has fallen, and the first time in five years that there has been a year-on-year decrease.  Pat Boyden of accountants PricewaterhouseCoopers said this drop reflected the fact that borrowing on credit cards has been tailing off.  There has been a fall for the last couple of years, so the insolvency figures have levelled off, he said.  Although bankruptcy levels are still 2.2% higher than a year ago, IVAs are now running 14% lower than at the same stage in 2006.  Lee Manning, an insolvency expert at accountancy firm Deloitte, said that was because firms which specialise in setting up IVAs were having to become more circumspect.  There has been considerable pressure on IVA specialists to be more fussy about the cases they take on, he said.  There have been examples of proposed IVAs that were inappropriate and for which the fees were too high.  Repossessions  Despite the fall in the number of repossession orders that lenders have gained in the courts - the first stage in the repossession process - there have been warnings this week that actual repossessions will rise by about 50% next year.  The Council of Mortgage Lenders predicted that repossessions could rise to 45,000 by the end of 2008, with the number of mortgages more than three months in arrears also going up, by 17% to 170,000.  It said this would be due to homeowners finding it impossible to keep up with rising mortgage payments.  Mark Sands, from accountancy firm KPMG, said this in turn would drive up the personal insolvency figures.  They are both driven by the same factors; the ability to refinance and the pressures on household budgets, he said.  We expect long term that they will go up hand-in-hand with repossessions next year.  Have you been affected by the issues covered in this story?

McCanns launch new appeal	Gold price dips from 27-year high	Many stallholders at Bath's Farmers' Market say they are unhappy about plans for expansion.  The local eco-group Envolve has taken over the market and said it wants to attract more traders and a greater variety of products.  But those who currently work on the market say they are worried that the character of the event will be ruined.  There are also fears that they may lose control and be saddled with significant rises in rent.  The market has strict criteria for locally produced goods.  Traders are meeting with bosses next Saturday.
House price falls 'don't matter'	Kasabian to headline Hogmanay	
Over-50s get networking website	Council 'toughest' over parking	BSkyB boosted pay-TV customers over the past three months, but a continuing row with cable network provider Virgin Media dented profits.  Sky added 83,000 net new customers in the quarter with churn - a measure of subscriptions cancelled - falling to its lowest level in more than a year.  But the firm's pre-tax profit fell to 121m, down from 166m a year earlier.  Virgin's refusal to screen certain key Sky channels because of a row over transmission costs was partly to blame.  Virgin launched a High Court action against BSkyB in April, accusing the broadcaster of abusing its dominant position in the pay-TV market.  The overall picture from a market perspective is still positive  Richard Hunter, equity strategist, Hargreaves Lansdown  See BSkyB's shares  Why is the Sky-Virgin row about?  According to an agreed timetable, the case is unlikely to be heard before next summer.  The firm estimated that its operating profit would be hurt by about 15m for each full quarter that the channels, including Sky One, Sky News and Sky Sports News, remained unavailable to Virgin Media's 3.3 million subscribers.  We expect that performance for the full year will be in line with our plans, said James Murdoch, BSkyB chief executive.  Silver lining?  Other reasons given for the fall in profit included higher marketing costs and substantial investment in its recently launched broadband and phone packages.  The new contract to cover Premier League football and spending on programmes such as Sky One's much-advertised Are You Smarter Than A 10-Year-Old, were also cited as contributed to added costs.  BSkyB shares closed down 4.3% at 660p following the trading update.  Analysts were encouraged by surging demand for the Sky+ and High Definition TV services as well as the popularity of Sky's broadband package, which has attracted one million customers in 14 months.  But Richard Hunter, equity strategist at Hargreaves Lansdown, said the run on Sky's shares centred around some slight disappointment on the profit numbers.  This, he noted, came on top of continuing uncertainty surrounding the firm's contentious 17.9% stake in rival broadcaster ITV and the distraction of the Virgin Media lawsuit.  Nonetheless, the overall picture from a market perspective is still positive, he added.  Sky's stated aim of 10 million pay-TV customers by 2010 continues to look eminently achievable, and the initial success of the broadband offering in little over a year is proof of Sky's ambition and marketing prowess.
Employment boosts US economy	PS3 network enters record books	Police are continuing to question a man and a woman arrested after a police officer was hit by a car as she tried to arrest the driver.  Det Con Catherine Corbett, 39, of Solihull, remains in a critical condition after the incident in Hayes, west London, on Friday morning.  A man, 41, was arrested in Birmingham on suspicion of the attempted murder of the West Midlands Police officer.  A 32-year-old woman is also being held in London in connection with the case.  Det Con Corbett was trying to arrest a man outside the Sheraton Skyline Hotel, near Heathrow Airport, when he drove off and knocked her over at 0800 GMT.  Police said the officer was hit by the open passenger door as the suspect reversed away from the scene in a blue Peugeot 207.  Fraud inquiry  She suffered serious head injuries and underwent surgery at Charing Cross Hospital's neurological unit on Friday night.  A spokeswoman for West Midlands Police said: She is now out of surgery and everything went well, but her condition is still critical.  Our thoughts and prayers are with Cathy and her family and we are anxiously waiting news from the hospital.  The suspect also crashed into a Ford Focus  A man arrested in Bordesley Green, Birmingham, on Friday, was transferred to a London police station overnight.  A woman was also arrested in connection with the inquiry after she attended a London police station.  Police said as the suspect left the car park the vehicle collided with a black Ford Focus, damaging its front bumper and bonnet.  Two other male officers also suffered minor injuries as they were carried for a short distance on the bonnet of the Peugeot.  The car was later found abandoned in Harlington Road.  Det Con Corbett had been in London for the previous two days as part of a fraud investigation.  Detectives said they had been hunting the suspect for about 12 months.
Inquiry into Haiti UN sex claims	NHS staff protest against reforms	US singer Meat Loaf has cancelled Friday's concert at the Birmingham NEC owing to acute laryngitis.  Staff at the arena had told the BBC earlier that the singer would be performing as planned - just days after he walked out of a gig in Newcastle.  He reportedly told fans it would be his final concert, but promoters later said he had been suffering from exhaustion.  The NEC has rescheduled the concert for Thursday 29 November and all existing tickets will be honoured.  'Devastating'  Meat Loaf - born Marvin Lee Aday - said: Performing for my fans is the most important thing in the world to me. Over the years, I've gone on stage with a broken foot and an arrhythmic heart.  It was devastating having to come off stage in Newcastle but over time, I've reluctantly learned that I have to abide by what the doctors tell me to do.  Meat Loaf, 60, was about an hour into his performance at the Metro Radio Arena on Wednesday when he abruptly stopped, thanked the audience and left the stage.  Several audience members told the BBC he had described the concert as the last show I may ever do in my life.  Shortly afterwards an announcement was made saying he had been taken ill with a throat problem.  His promoter, however, played down the Bat Out of Hell star's comments, attributing them to exhaustion and stress.  Meat Loaf is due to perform in Manchester, London, Nottingham and Cardiff as part of the European leg of his Three Bats Tour.
Meat Loaf cancels Birmingham gig	New school motto: Hit that target	A man in his 40s has died following an argument outside a shop in Nottingham during which he was assaulted.  Police were called to an altercation on Barncroft in Chilwell outside Deepak Stores at about 1145 GMT on Friday.  The man collapsed on the street after he was assaulted by people who were seen in a white stretch limousine.  He was taken to the Queen's Medical Centre where he died later that afternoon. Police have urged anyone with information to contact them.  The scene was cordoned off for several hours and officers are carrying out house-to-house inquiries.  Supt Mike Mamley said: Incidents like this are rare in Chilwell and it has shocked the local community. We are determined to catch those responsible.
Two still held over officer crash	Girl speaks of funfair ride crash	Shares in Barclays Bank have fallen to two-and-a-half-year lows amid continuing speculation about funding problems linked to the credit crunch.  The shares fell by 8% to 524.5p at one point but later recovered, closing down 5.9%, or 34 pence, at 537.5p.  Rumours about Barclays first emerged in August when technical problems twice forced the bank to borrow overnight funds from the Bank of England.  Barclays declined to comment but has always denied having funding problems.  In a move designed to allay market fears the bank's head of global retail and commercial banking, Frits Seegers, bought Barclays shares worth almost 700,000 ($1.5m) on Friday.  There are concerns about writedowns and everything else, but the comments Barclays have made to date suggest that is not an issue, as does the fact they are still buying back their own shares, said Ian Poulter at Landsbanki Financials.
Saints issue warning over finance	Man, 93, dies after car park row	The Tamil Tigers have vowed revenge after the man believed to be their number two was killed in a Sri Lankan air force raid.  The military said SP Thamilselvan was at a meeting with other leaders in a camp when it was targeted on Friday.  There are fears the killing could lead to an escalation of the war with the rebels, who want an independent state for the Tamil minority.  Sri Lanka's government has described the killing as a major success.  The rebels' top leader, Velupillai Prabhakaran, has made a rare public appearance to mourn SP Thamilselvan.  The Tamil Tigers' spokesman, Rasiah Ilanthiriyan, told the BBC the group's response to the killing would be in deeds, not words.  'Surprise'  But the rebel spokesman refused to be drawn on the manner of the retaliation they would take. He said it had to be a surprise.  If we want we can take them one by one, so they must change their hideouts  Defence Secretary Gotabaya Rajapaksa  Have your say - what now?  Thamilselvan obituary  SP Thamilselvan was the head of the rebels' political wing and held an important position in their hierarchy.  In areas they control, the Tigers have declared three days of mourning for SP Thamilsevan and the five others killed in the bombing raid.  SP Thamilsevan's death follows that of another key rebel spokesman, Anton Balasingham, last year.  Sri Lanka's Defence Secretary, Gotabaya Rajapaksa, said: If we want we can take them one by one, so they must change their hideouts.  Mr Thamilselvan was the public face of the rebels  The rebels announced on Friday their police chief, P Nadesan, would replace Mr Thamilselvan. He will also remain in charge of police.  The pro-rebel TamilNet website said the air strike had been carried out in Kilinochchi, the rebels' northern stronghold.  It followed a Tamil Tiger attack on an air force base at Anuradhapura last week which left 14 security forces personnel dead and destroyed eight aircraft.  Observers say the two sides now seem to be gearing up for a major confrontation in the north of the country.  The rebels are fighting for autonomy for minority Tamils in the north and east, claiming discrimination by the majority Sinhalese population.  About 70,000 people have died in more than 20 years of war.
Driving the boundaries of realism	Dallaglio fears Test career over	A US astronaut has carried out a dangerous spacewalk to repair a damaged solar panel on the International Space Station (ISS).  The energy-collecting wing developed a rip when it was being unfurled at the port end of the platform on Tuesday.  Scott Parazynski rode on the end of an extension boom to install home-made cufflinks to the broken section.  The repair work will enable the wing to be fully deployed and properly locked in position.  Mr Parazynski was supported from a nearby girder by spacewalking colleague Douglas Wheelock.  Mr Parazynski had to carry out the work without touching the torn solar panel, which could have given him a powerful shock if touched. His suit and tools were insulated for protection.  Vital repair  Beautiful, said Mr Parazynsky as he completed more than fours hours of work outside the space station, more than 200 miles (320km) above the Earth.  A controller at Houston, Texas Mission Control, told the astronauts: Nice teamwork... excellent work guys.  The repair was of vital importance to future shuttle flights.  Unless the wing can be extended fully, it may not be able to withstand the loading put on the platform when the orbiter docks.  The panel had to be lashed together where it had come apart  Nasa officials say the 35m (115ft) wing probably snagged on a guidewire, or guidewire support, as it was being unfurled.  The next shuttle, due in December, is supposed to deliver Europe's main contribution to the ISS project - its Columbus laboratory.  Failure to sort the solar panel problem would have left Nasa no choice but to delay the December flight , keeping the already much-delayed Columbus sitting on the ground even longer.  The ISS is currently being visited by space shuttle Discovery. Astronauts from the orbiter have already attached the new Harmony module to a temporary location on the station. The unit will be moved into a permanent site once the orbiter has left.  Harmony will act as a passageway between three science laboratories: The existing US Destiny lab, and the soon-to-launch European Columbus and Japanese Kibo experimental units.

Card companies lose refund case	Indiana Jones thief pleads guilty	A former Roman Catholic Archbishop of Birmingham has died aged 78, the city's archdiocese has said.  The Most Rev Maurice Couve de Murville died peacefully in St Joseph's Nursing Home in Littlehampton, West Sussex, at about 0615 GMT on Saturday.  Archbishop Maurice was the seventh person to hold the title, from 1982 to 1999, and retired due to ill health.  He was born in France and his cousin, who shared his name, was prime minister of France from 1968 to 1969.  One of Archbishop Maurice's first engagements in the job was to welcome Pope John Paul II to Coventry Airport in 1982 during his visit to Britain.  'Dignity and calm'  The Most Rev Vincent Nichols, Archbishop of Birmingham, said: The Archdiocese of Birmingham will be at prayer for their late Archbishop Maurice. He was much loved by so many who admired his achievements and his humour.  Characteristically he bore his last illness with dignity and calm, with his strong faith and trust in the Lord so much to the fore.  The archdiocese covers Birmingham, the Black Country, Staffordshire, Warwickshire, Worcestershire, Oxfordshire and parts of Berkshire.  The archbishop dealt with some of the first child abuse cases within the Catholic church, an archdiocese spokesman said.  The spokesman added: Dealing with these events, which inflicted so much harm on their victims, caused him great distress.
PS3 network enters record books	EMI 'artists need to work harder'	
Google shares pass $700	Australian TV host found dead	Ant McPartlin and Dec Donnelly have won three categories at the National Television Awards, which have been held at the Royal Albert Hall in London.  Their ITV1 series I'm a Celebrity... Get Me Out of Here! was top reality show and the duo were named best hosts.  Their Saturday Night Takeaway show, one of several ITV1 hits to be caught up in a recent phone-in scandal, received the prize for best entertainment programme.  Doctor Who won two awards, including best drama for the third year running.  Thank you for watching it; thank you for enjoying it, David Tennant, who plays the Doctor, told viewers in one of his acceptance speeches.  I'm having the time of my life and I'm so glad you're enjoying it, he said.  Best soap  McPartlin and Donnelly were unable to attend the ceremony as they were in Los Angeles, on the way to Australia to film the next series of I'm a Celebrity...  Instead, they used a live satellite link-up to accept their awards.  McPartlin sent out a massive heartfelt thank you to everybody who voted for us.  We are over the moon, he added.  I was a bit miffed that Al Gore won the peace certificate [Nobel Prize]. This more than makes up for it  Jeremy Clarkson  In full: TV Awards winners  In pictures: TV Awards 2007  Earlier this month it emerged that two of the pair's shows, Saturday Night Takeaway and Ant and Dec's Gameshow Marathon, had deceived viewers.  Winners of contests on each programme were not chosen at random, as advertised.  The pair were executive producers of Saturday Night Takeaway but insisted they had no knowledge of what had taken place.  In Wednesday night's speeches from Los Angeles, neither star apologised for the scandal, despite rumours backstage they would do so.  Donnelly did, however, say it had been quite a couple of weeks.  He paid tribute to ITV, the staff working on his shows and viewers, adding: Thank you to everybody that has taken the time to vote for us. We are very grateful.  BBC One's EastEnders won two awards - best popular serial, commonly known as soaps, and best actress. This went to Lacey Turner, seen in the show as Stacey.  Former Hear'Say singer Kym Ryder was named most popular newcomer for her role as barmaid Michelle Connor in Coronation Street.  Special recognition  For the second year running the BBC Two motoring series Top Gear won best factual show.  This time presenter Richard Hammond was able to collect the award in person. Last year he was unable to attend as he was recovering from a high-speed crash which occurred during filming.  Racing driver Lewis Hamilton presented another Top Gear host, Jeremy Clarkson, with the special recognition award.  On accepting the trophy, Clarkson joked: I was a bit miffed that Al Gore won the peace certificate [Nobel Prize]. This more than makes up for it.  EastEnders star Lacey Turner took home the prize for best actress  He revealed he had no idea he was to collect the award, before congratulating Hamilton on his own phenomenal year in Formula One.  Little Britain's David Walliams and Matt Lucas, winners last year, donned their Lou and Andy costumes to present the best comedy award.  That went to The Catherine Tate Show, although Tate did not attend the event.  The X Factor picked up the gong for best talent show, which viewers were invited to vote for while the ceremony was broadcast.  Veteran newsreader Sir Trevor McDonald hosted the awards, all of which were decided by a public vote.
Two sailors start 4,000-mile race	PC stripper helps spam to spread	US oil firm Chevron has seen quarterly profits fall by 25% after it was hit, like other energy firms, by lower gas prices and a drop in margins.  Its profits missed forecasts after reduced output at refineries failed to outweigh rising crude oil prices.  Chevron made a $3.72bn (1.78bn) profit for the three months to the end of September, down from $5.01bn last year.  An unplanned closure in Mississippi and a scheduled shut-down in California both dented Chevron's output.  'Chronic performance'  While profits fell, revenue climbed to $55.17bn from $54.21bn a year earlier.  The firm's chief executive said one reason for the profit slide was an oversupply of gas in the markets.  Profits at the firm's global refining and marketing business dropped 74% to $377m, with its US division making a $110m loss.  This company continues to operate its US refining system poorly and this is chronic, said Mark Gilman, an analyst with Benchmark.  Chevron's results come a day after Exxon Mobil reported a 10% drop in quarterly profits while, in October, BP saw profits fall by 45% after it too was hit by refining problems.
Officer 'failed' over fall death	Man held in counter-terror raid	The technology behind the wind-up radio could soon be helping to light up some of the poorest homes in Africa.  The Freeplay Foundation is developing prototypes of a charging station for house lights it hopes will improve the quality of life for many Africans.  The Foundation said the lights would replace the expensive, polluting and unhealthy alternatives many Africans currently use to light their homes.  Field testing of the prototypes will start in Kenya in the next few months.  Light and life  Kristine Pearson, director of the Freeplay Foundation, said few Africans in the continents most vulnerable areas had access to electricity to light homes.  Their life stops or is very narrowed when the sun goes down, she said. Two extra hours of light would make a big difference to their life.  The World Bank estimates that more than 500 million people in sub-Saharan Africa do not have access to electricity supplies that could be used to light their homes.  Instead, said Ms Pearson, many used kerosene lamps, battery-powered lights or wood fires as sources of illumination after sundown.  Buying kerosene or batteries can consume up to 15% of a household's budget, said Ms Pearson. In addition wood was hard to gather and unhealthy to burn.  As part of its LifeLight Project the Freeplay Foundation has drawn up designs for a charging base unit that would be able to power up several detachable lights that can be used around a home.  The Foundation aims to train women to sell and maintain the lights  They could use them for study or for safety - to help them if they go somewhere at night, said Ms Pearson.  Working prototypes are now being made that will be tested with families in Kenya to refine the design.  Freeplay technology has already been used to create wind-up torches and small lights said Ms Pearson but the LifeLight Project aims to make bigger, brighter bulbs for homes.  She said the Foundation was adopting a similar approach to that used for the wind-up Lifeline radio to get the lights to families.  Instead of just giving the lights out and then leaving, the Foundation aims to recruit women who will sell the lights and be trained to repair and maintain them for customers.  Ms Pearson said the take up of the lights was likely to be rapid because it would piggyback on the network created by the Foundation to maintain Lifeline radios.  Since it was established in 1998 the Foundation has given out more than 150,000 Lifeline radios.  Ms Pearson said the Foundation had applied for a grant to fund the design and testing work from the World Bank as part of that organisation's Lighting Africa initiative.
Search for missing firefighters	December shoot for X Files sequel	Google's shares have passed $700 for the first time, lifted by reports it plans to enter the mobile phone market.  Its stock rose 1.7% to $707 on Wednesday on rumours it is working with US networks Verizon and Sprint Nextel.  While none of the firms have commented, Google is said to be looking at mobile phones that run on its software.  The value of Google's shares have now risen eightfold since they were first floated in August 2004, as its profit growth continues to dazzle.  It is now the fifth largest US company by market capitalisation, worth a total $219bn (105bn), surpassed by only Exxon Mobile, General Electric, Microsoft and AT&T.  'Make a splash'  Analyst Avi Greengart of Current Analysis speculated about how Google would be able to tempt mobile phone networks to use its phones.  If Google is going to make a splash, it's going to have to say [to operators], 'Offer our phone and we'll share the revenue,' he said.  Last month, Google saw its net profit for the three months to end of September soar 46% to $1.07bn, compared with $733.4m for the same period last year.  Google's share price has risen by $100 since then.  The world's most popular internet search engine, Google makes the bulk of its money from advertising.  Last year, it spent $1.65bn buying video-sharing website YouTube.  Google's shares were priced at $84 when they debuted in 2004.

Protest as memorial unveiled	Pizza worker was unfairly sacked	
Kasabian to headline Hogmanay	Record payout for sacked worker	A US astronaut has carried out a dangerous spacewalk to repair a damaged solar panel on the International Space Station (ISS).  The energy-collecting wing developed a rip when it was being unfurled at the port end of the platform on Tuesday.  Scott Parazynski rode on the end of an extension boom to install home-made cufflinks to the broken section.  The repair work will enable the wing to be fully deployed and properly locked in position.  Mr Parazynski was supported from a nearby girder by spacewalking colleague Douglas Wheelock.  Mr Parazynski had to carry out the work without touching the torn solar panel, which could have given him a powerful shock if touched. His suit and tools were insulated for protection.  Vital repair  Beautiful, said Mr Parazynsky as he completed more than fours hours of work outside the space station, more than 200 miles (320km) above the Earth.  A controller at Houston, Texas Mission Control, told the astronauts: Nice teamwork... excellent work guys.  The repair was of vital importance to future shuttle flights.  Unless the wing can be extended fully, it may not be able to withstand the loading put on the platform when the orbiter docks.  The panel had to be lashed together where it had come apart  Nasa officials say the 35m (115ft) wing probably snagged on a guidewire, or guidewire support, as it was being unfurled.  The next shuttle, due in December, is supposed to deliver Europe's main contribution to the ISS project - its Columbus laboratory.  Failure to sort the solar panel problem would have left Nasa no choice but to delay the December flight , keeping the already much-delayed Columbus sitting on the ground even longer.  The ISS is currently being visited by space shuttle Discovery. Astronauts from the orbiter have already attached the new Harmony module to a temporary location on the station. The unit will be moved into a permanent site once the orbiter has left.  Harmony will act as a passageway between three science laboratories: The existing US Destiny lab, and the soon-to-launch European Columbus and Japanese Kibo experimental units.
Virgin dispute hits BSkyB profits	Memorial for plane crash victims	A bounty hunter has had his show pulled from US TV schedules after he used a racist term repeatedly in a phone call.  The A&E network said Dog the Bounty Hunter, starring Duane Dog Chapman, would be off-air for the foreseeable future, but had not been scrapped.  The National Enquirer released a recording of a conversation involving the star, repeatedly making derogatory remarks about his son's girlfriend.  He issued an apology but several civil rights leaders want his show ditched.  They have written to A&E, branding his comments a vicious attack on... interracial relations, as well as an incitement to violence.  Chapman's programme sees him and colleagues trying to find people who have absconded in Hawaii and other US states.  'Ashamed'  In the phone call, Chapman was heard talking to his son Tucker, urging him to break up with his black girlfriend.  He used the offensive N-word six times in the first 45 seconds of the five-minute clip, the Associated Press reported.  In his apology, Chapman said he was ashamed of himself and should never have used that term.  And he added he was disappointed in his son's choice of girlfriend not due to her race, but her character.  The 54-year-old's lawyer, Brook Hart, said Chapman was not a racist and promised the word would never be used again by the star.
NHS staff protest against reforms	The game of love	Upgrading to the latest version of Apple's operating system, might make a Mac less secure, say experts.  A test of Leopard revealed that installing it led to the firewall on a Mac being turned off and its default setting changed to leave it disabled.  Heise Security, who conducted the tests, said the failings meant users could not rely on the firewall to protect them.  Apple has yet to comment about the security shortcomings in Leopard.  Leopard, the newest version of OS X, was launched on 26 October and since then Apple claims to have sold or delivered more than two million copies of the software.  But a test of Leopard by Heise Security security expert Jurgen Schmidt found that the firewall in the updated software was set to off and allowed any and every incoming net connection.  Mr Schmidt also found that installing the software as an upgrade to a machine on which the firewall was turned on would lead to this protective software being turned off when that computer was re-started.  He also found that even when the firewall was re-activated it did not let users know about all the potentially vulnerable processes running on that machine.  Commenting for Heise Mike Barwise, editor of the site, said: This as a serious problem: It provides a false sense of security, which is more dangerous than a lack of actual security that you know about.  Apple has yet to respond to a BBC request for comment on the Heise findings.  Mikko Hypponen, chief research officer at F-Secure, said: Year after year, Macs continue to have these potential security problems.  However, in practice they just don't seem to become real-world problems, he added. The old wisdom still stands: if you want to avoid viruses and worms, get a Mac.
Digital magnetic map goes global	Iraq vows to arrest PKK rebels	Sri Lanka has promised to look into allegations that 108 of its UN peacekeepers in Haiti paid for sex, in some cases with underage girls.  The men are being sent home after being accused of sexual misconduct and abuse.  Officials say the law will take its course once the soldiers arrive back in Sri Lanka, but warn that little tangible evidence has been produced.  In the past, UN peacekeepers have been involved in a series of sex scandals, including this year in Ivory Coast.  'Zero tolerance'  Sri Lanka has sent four senior officers, including a female brigadier, to Haiti to investigate.  The United Nations and the Sri Lankan government deeply regret any sexual exploitation and abuse that has occurred.  Michelle MontasUN spokesman  Sri Lanka's Foreign Secretary, Dr Palitha Kohona, said the allegations against the soldiers were a blight on what he described as the country's stunningly good record in United Nations peacekeeping.  He added though that little tangible evidence had been provided by the United Nations, which might make it difficult to bring them before a court.  The UN mission in Haiti has requested an immediate investigation by the organisation's internal watchdog.  The UN has a zero tolerance policy on peacekeepers visiting prostitutes, regardless of local laws.  Spokeswoman Michele Montas said: The United Nations and the Sri Lankan government deeply regret any sexual exploitation and abuse that has occurred.  The [soldiers] are back under national jurisdiction. So far Sri Lanka has said... that they are going to be prosecuted in Sri Lanka.  Earlier this year more than 700 peacekeepers in Ivory Coast were suspended and in recent years, peacekeepers in Liberia and the Democratic Republic of Congo have also been accused of sexual exploitation.  Member states are supplying about 100,000 troops to peacekeeping operations worldwide.  The 950-strong peacekeeping operation in Haiti is the first to which Sri Lanka has sent a full contingent of troops, although some officers have joined earlier missions.
Australian TV host found dead	Kicking off the free speech debate	South African police say they have arrested an employee at US chat-show host Oprah Winfrey's Leadership Academy for Girls on abuse charges.  One girl at the school said she had been fondled; others reported being sworn at, grabbed by the neck, beaten or thrown against a wall.  An internal investigation resulted in a dossier being handed to Gauteng's child protection unit.  Ms Winfrey has twice visited the school at Henley-on-Klip to offer support.  Controversy  Police spokesperson Superintendent Lungelo Dlamini said the 27-year-old woman, a dormitory employee, was arrested on Thursday by the Family Violence, Child Protection and Sexual Offences Unit.  Several charges including alleged assault, indecent assault, crimen injuria and soliciting under-age girls to perform indecent acts are being investigated against her, South African Press Association quotes him as saying.  The girls said they had told the principal, Mbulelo Mzimane, about their complaints but she had failed to act.  The school promptly suspended both the principal and two matrons and offered counselling to its 150 boarders.  Ms Winfrey pledged to build the $40m academy after a meeting with former South African President Nelson Mandela six years ago and she personally interviewed many of the 3,500 South African girls from low income families who applied for the initial 150 places at the school.  The BBC African Service's Nick Ericsson says the school - which is free for pupils - has been no stranger to controversy since it opened its doors in a high-profile launch in January.  Some parents have complained that not only was the academy imposing too many restrictions on their children - with minimal contact being allowed between parents and children - but that junk food was strictly forbidden on the school grounds.

Man in court over schoolgirl gun	Officer 'failed' over fall death	Councillors in Cornwall have begun to prepare for turning the county's local councils into a unitary authority.  Some of the districts had waged a campaign against the single status plan, claiming it would not benefit the taxpayers.  But Cornwall County Council said becoming a unitary authority would eventually save taxpayers 17m a year.  Councillor Graham Facks-Martin said the meeting of the 24 representatives had been constructive.  The councillors represented the county council and six district councils.  Jobs concern  The district councils have waged a campaign against the creation of the controversial single authority - some making claims of it being too centralised and undemocratic.  A unitary authority will be responsible for roads and education, as well as leisure, environmental health and housing.  If unitary status is approved there will be a reduction in the number of councillors.  The public service union Unison has raised concerns about the effect the change could have on jobs.  Subject to legislation the new authority could be up and running in 2009.

MySpace in Google software deal	Digital magnetic map goes global	BSkyB boosted pay-TV customers over the past three months, but a continuing row with cable network provider Virgin Media dented profits.  Sky added 83,000 net new customers in the quarter with churn - a measure of subscriptions cancelled - falling to its lowest level in more than a year.  But the firm's pre-tax profit fell to 121m, down from 166m a year earlier.  Virgin's refusal to screen certain key Sky channels because of a row over transmission costs was partly to blame.  Virgin launched a High Court action against BSkyB in April, accusing the broadcaster of abusing its dominant position in the pay-TV market.  The overall picture from a market perspective is still positive  Richard Hunter, equity strategist, Hargreaves Lansdown  See BSkyB's shares  Why is the Sky-Virgin row about?  According to an agreed timetable, the case is unlikely to be heard before next summer.  The firm estimated that its operating profit would be hurt by about 15m for each full quarter that the channels, including Sky One, Sky News and Sky Sports News, remained unavailable to Virgin Media's 3.3 million subscribers.  We expect that performance for the full year will be in line with our plans, said James Murdoch, BSkyB chief executive.  Silver lining?  Other reasons given for the fall in profit included higher marketing costs and substantial investment in its recently launched broadband and phone packages.  The new contract to cover Premier League football and spending on programmes such as Sky One's much-advertised Are You Smarter Than A 10-Year-Old, were also cited as contributed to added costs.  BSkyB shares closed down 4.3% at 660p following the trading update.  Analysts were encouraged by surging demand for the Sky+ and High Definition TV services as well as the popularity of Sky's broadband package, which has attracted one million customers in 14 months.  But Richard Hunter, equity strategist at Hargreaves Lansdown, said the run on Sky's shares centred around some slight disappointment on the profit numbers.  This, he noted, came on top of continuing uncertainty surrounding the firm's contentious 17.9% stake in rival broadcaster ITV and the distraction of the Virgin Media lawsuit.  Nonetheless, the overall picture from a market perspective is still positive, he added.  Sky's stated aim of 10 million pay-TV customers by 2010 continues to look eminently achievable, and the initial success of the broadband offering in little over a year is proof of Sky's ambition and marketing prowess.
Labour 'united despite mistakes'	High Street 'feeling the pinch'	Two police officers were hurt when their patrol vehicles collided on a trunk road on North Tyneside.  The accident happened on the northbound section of the A1 at Seaton Burn, near the junction with the A19, in the early hours of Saturday.  While responding to an emergency, a police patrol Land Rover collided with a police transit van, travelling in the same direction, which then overturned.  Neither officer was seriously hurt, and no members of the public were involved.  'Unfortunate incident'  The crash happened after police were called to an incident involving three suspicious males near Ilford Road Metro station in Newcastle.  A youth was arrested at the scene, but a vehicle made off and was followed by police along the A1 to Stannington village where it eventually stopped.  Two youths were then arrested.  The vehicles involved in the accident were on their way to assist with the incident.  Insp Neil Fraser, of Northumbria Police, said: Police drivers receive specific training, and this was an unfortunate incident in which no members of the public were involved.  An investigation into the accident is ongoing.
Search for missing firefighters	X Factor Emily pulls out of show	A council claiming to be one of the toughest on parking offenders has said figures prove how well it does its job.  Reigate and Banstead Borough Council in Surrey said it was the toughest borough in England and Wales in which to appeal against a parking fine.  It follows a report by the National Parking Adjudication Service.  Councillor Joan Spiers said wardens did not have any quotas to meet, but the authority took parking enforcement very seriously.  She said: If you want to dodge a parking fine, don't do it in Reigate and Banstead.  Only 9% of appeals against fines were successful last year, and each one was challenged by the council, she added.  She said: Our wardens don't have quotas to meet and will only give a ticket if someone has parked where they shouldn't.  The small number of tickets overturned on appeal show just how well we do our job.  Reigate and Banstead issued 16,577 parking fines in 2006/07.
Jail term for Prison Break actor	Two sailors start 4,000-mile race	
Fire all clear for maternity ward	Dredged-up bomb detonated	William Gallas equalised in injury-time to salvage a draw and keep Arsenal on top of the Premier League after an absorbing clash with Manchester United.  Gallas turned Wayne Rooney's half-hit effort into his own goal on the stroke of half time to give United the lead.  Cesc Fabregas' cool finish put Arsenal level two minutes after the break, but Cristiano Ronaldo slid home Patrice Evra's cross nine minutes from time.  But Gallas then scrambled in Gael Clichy's cross to earn a point.  Interview: Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger  Interview: Man Utd midfielder Ryan Giggs  Interview: Man Utd assistant boss Carlos Queiroz  The Frenchman's equaliser allowed Arsenal to set a new club record of 25 games unbeaten in all competitions.  The opening 45 minutes proved an anti-climax until Gallas diverted Rooney's tame shot in on the stroke of half-time.  Arsenal had reasonable penalty claims ignored by referee Howard Webb after 15 minutes when Nemanja Vidic tugged Alexander Hleb's shirt as they tangled in the area.  United had a good chance seconds later when Bacary Sagna failed to react to Ronaldo's cross and Ryan Giggs, perhaps caught by surprise, could only turn a close-range effort wide.  Owen Hargreaves was outstanding in shielding United's defence from Arsenal's attacking threat, but he was powerless as the Gunners almost went ahead after 35 minutes.  Gallas escaped the attentions of the United rearguard to glance Fabregas' free-kick against the legs of Edwin van der Sar.  606: DEBATE  I think Arsenal showed championship qualities today  Apollian  United's Brazilian midfield man Anderson is clearly a talent, but he demonstrated an unsavoury side to his nature that predictably infuriated the crowd.  He flamboyantly demanded referee Webb show yellow cards to Arsenal players, then rolled in ridiculous fashion after a foul by Fabregas that earned the Spanish youngster a booking.  United staged a smash-and-grab in first-half stoppage time, Ronaldo crossing for Rooney, who failed to make a proper connection but saw Gallas provide a crucial deflection past Manuel Almunia.  The gauntlet was thrown down to Arsenal - but they picked it up to equalise two minutes after the restart.  Emmanuel Eboue played in Emmanuel Adebayor, who was blocked by Van der Sar, but Sagna crossed the loose ball for Fabregas to slide in a composed finish.  Arsenal had started to dominate possession, but it was United who had the next big chance after 63 minutes.  Giggs found Rooney in space in the area, but he headed wastefully wide when he should have at least worked keeper Almunia.  Both managers made changes in the final 15 minutes, Wenger sending on Theo Walcott for Eboue, while Ferguson replaced the subdued Carlos Tevez and Anderson with Louis Saha and Michael Carrick.  The changes worked better for United as they took a vital lead with nine minutes left.  Walcott failed to track Evra, and when Saha played him in he crossed perfectly for Ronaldo to score.  Evra then enjoyed a huge piece of luck when he sliced substitute Eduardo da Silva's cross against his own bar with Van der Sar helpless.  Arsenal pressed forward and got the draw they deserved when Clichy's cross sparked a goalmouth scramble which ended with a shot from Gallas which, even though Van der Sar clawed it out, had clearly crossed the line.  Arsenal: Almunia, Sagna, Toure, Gallas, Clichy, Eboue (Walcott 74), Fabregas, Flamini, Rosicky (Eduardo 80), Hleb (Silva 80), Adebayor.Subs Not Used: Lehmann, Diarra.  Booked: Fabregas.
